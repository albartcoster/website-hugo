abstract = {Aims: To assess the effects of inoculation of Lactobacillus buchneri on the ensiling properties and aerobic stability of maize silage. Methods and Results: Chopped whole crop maize was ensiled in 0.5 litre airtight polyethylene bottles (0.4 kg per bottle) and in double-layered, thin polyethylene bags (15 kg per bag), with or without inoculation of Lact. buchneri. The silos were stored for two to four months and the chemical composition, microbial numbers and aerobic stability were determined. Inoculation lowered lactic acid and yeasts, and increased acetic acid and pH value, resulting in improved aerobic stability of the silages. Inoculated silages produced 1,2-propanediol, the content of which increased as ensiling was prolonged, and nearly 50 g kg-1 dry matter had accumulated after four months of storage. The effects of inoculation, however, were much less pronounced in silages prepared in bags. Mannitol was found in all silages; the production was lowered by Lact. buchneri treatment and appeared to be unrelated to the accumulation of 1,2-propanediol. Conclusions: Inoculation of Lact. buchneri occasionally causes accumulation of 1,2-propanediol in silages without further degradation into propionic acid and 1-propanol. Significance and Impact of the Study: Substantial amounts of 1,2-propanediol could be consumed by ruminants when fed on silages inoculated with Lact. buchneri. In addition to increasing acetic acid, attention needs to be paid to 1,2-propanediol because the two fermentation products might affect the intake and utilization of silage-based diets.},

abstract = {
A systematic review of the scientific literature on relationships between management practices used on dairy farms and herd somatic cell count (SCC) was undertaken to distinguish those management practices that have been consistently shown to be associated with herd SCC from those lacking evidence of association. Relevant literature was identified using a combination of database searches (PubMed, Medline, CAB, Agricola, and Web of Science) and iterative screening of references. To be included in the review, a manuscript had to be published after 1979 in French, English, or Dutch; study design had to be other than case report or case series; herds studied had to be composed of {\textgreater}=40 milking cows producing on average {\textgreater}=7,000 kg of milk in 305 d; interventions studied had to be management practices applied at the herd level and used as udder health control strategies; and SCC had to be measured using electronic cell counting methods. The 36 manuscripts selected were mainly observational cross-sectional studies; 8 manuscripts dealt exclusively with automatic milking systems and 4 with management of calves and heifers and its effect on SCC in early lactation heifers. Most practices having consistent associations with SCC were related to milking procedures: wearing gloves during milking, using automatic take-offs, using postmilking teat dipping, milking problem cows last, yearly inspection of the milking system, and use of a technique to keep cows standing following milking; all were consistently associated with lower herd SCC. Other practices associated with lower SCC were the use of a freestall system, sand bedding, cleaning the calving pen after each calving, surveillance of dry-cow udders for mastitis, use of blanket dry-cow therapy, parenteral selenium supplementation, udder hair management, and frequent use of the California Mastitis Test. Regarding SCC of heifers, most of the consistent associations reported were related to interventions made during the peripartum period. Studies on automatic milking systems have frequently reported elevation of the herd SCC following transition to the new system. These elevations seemed to be mediated both by the lack of monitoring of chronically infected cows and by an elevated incidence of intramammary infections. By assembling the results reported in many different studies, this review generates a more comprehensive understanding of the management practices influencing SCC and highlights areas of SCC control knowledge that lack evidence of effectiveness.},

abstract = {Straws of seven rice cultivars from a plant breeding experiment were analyzed for their chemical composition and nylon bag organic matter (NBOMD) and cell wall degradability (NDFD) with and without 3 or 4{\%} level of urea treatment. A significant (P {\textless} 0.01) variation of 70 and 100 g/kg in NBOMD and NDFD respectively was found among the different cultivar's untreated straws. Urea treatment improved NBOMD and NDFD by 80 and 100 g/kg, respectively, without differences between 3 or 4{\%} levels of urea. The improvement in dry matter degradability (DMD) due to urea treatment was found higher in rice straw having lower DMD in untreated straw and was found to be negatively correlated (r = −0.87∗) with the digestibility of untreated straw. In another in vivo digestion trial on crossbred heifers, the organic matter digestibility (OMD), NDFD and digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) were found significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher in straw of Kasturi cultivar over that of Sita. In nylon bag studies, the soluble fraction a and degradation rate constant c were found higher for Kasturi straw over that of Sita. The DMI was dependent on fraction a (r = 0.98∗) and c (r = 0.97∗ at P {\textless} 0.05). In another study, nine straw samples of different cultivars were incubated for 48 h in the rumen of two fistulated animals fed on 4 different diets consisting of; I: Wheat Bhusa (WB) + Sorghum (S) + 1 kg Concentrate (C); II: S + 1.5 kg C; III: S + 200 g Sodium Bicarbonate (Bic) and IV: S + 450 g bic. The DMD, NDFD and ADFD of straws were significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher on diet II and IV than that on diets I and III. However, hemicellulose degradability was reduced on diets III and IV. Different straws of rice cultivars also differed significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) among themselves in their nutrient degradability. Bicarbonate-supplemented diets III and IV had significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher rumen pH over diets I and II. The zero h DM disappearance (solubility) of straws determined at 0, 1, 2 and 3 h post feeding differed significantly (P {\textless} 0.01). The initial pH of the straw was found to have positive effect on the degradability of NDF (r = 0.74∗ at P {\textless} 0.05), DM (r = 0.71∗ at P {\textless} 0.05), nylon bag solubility (r = 0.88∗∗ at P {\textless} 0.01) and acid insoluble ash (AIA) in NDF of digested (r = 0.81∗∗ at P {\textless} 0.01) and undigested straw (r = 0.71∗ at P {\textless} 0.05). However, rumen pH was negatively correlated (r = −0.75∗∗ at P {\textless} 0.05) with rumen nylon bag DM solubility and hemicellulose degradability (r = −0.81∗∗ at P {\textless} 0.01). Loss of DM due to 1 h hot water refluxing at pH 7.6 was found negatively correlated (r = −0.81∗∗ at P {\textless} 0.01) with NDF content of the straw.},

abstract = {A formal mathematical framework is presented for the study of linkage in man and the concept of chromosome pedigree is defined for both autosomes and X chromosomes. It is shown that, assuming no interference, all the crossover processes in the pedigree may be viewed jointly as a continuous-time Markov random walk on the vertices of a hypercube, the time parameter being map distance along the chromosome. The event that two individuals have a segment of chromosome in common, thus proving them to be related, corresponds to the random walk hitting a particular set of vertices. The probability of this happening is calculated for various types of relationship, making use of the symmetry of the situation to partition the vertices into a very much smaller number of orbits and render the computation manageable. The probability that an individual with n children passes on all his or her genes to them is also calculated in this way.},

abstract = {Fifteen Holstein cows (10 multiparous and 5 primiparous) in early to mid lactation (79.3 +/- 9.2 d in milk) were used in a multiple 5 x 5 Latin square design with 4-wk periods to evaluate and compare the use of condensed corn distillers solubles (CCDS) and dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) in the total mixed ration. The forage portion of the diets was kept constant at 27.5{\%} corn silage and 27.5{\%} alfalfa hay (dry matter basis). Diets were 1) 0{\%} distillers grains products (control); 2) 18.5{\%} DDGS; 3) 10{\%} CCDS; 4) 20{\%} CCDS; and 5) a combination diet of 18.5{\%} DDGS with 10{\%} CCDS. Diets 2 and 3 contained 2{\%} fat from DDGS or CCDS, whereas diet 4 contained 4{\%} fat from CCDS and diet 5 contained 4{\%} fat from the blend of DDGS and CCDS. The diets were balanced to provide 17{\%} crude protein with variation in acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, and fat concentration. Dry matter intake (21.5 kg/d) was similar for all diets. Milk yield (33.8, 36.2, 35.5, 36.0, and 36.0 kg/d) tended to be greater for diets 2 to 5 than for diet 1, whereas yields of fat (1.04 kg/d), protein (1.02 kg/d), fat percentage (2.94), and protein percentage (2.98) were similar for all diets. Energy-corrected milk (32.2 kg/d) and feed efficiency (1.58 kg of energy-corrected milk/kg of dry matter intake) were similar for all diets. Milk urea nitrogen (15.0, 10.9, 11.1, 11.0, and 11.4 mg/dL) as well as blood urea nitrogen (15.6, 12.5, 14.6, 13.8, and 14.2 mg/dL) were decreased in diets 2 to 5 compared with diet 1. Milk concentrations of long-chain fatty acids as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids were greater and medium-chain fatty acid concentrations were lower for diets 2 to 5 compared with diet 1. Concentrations of cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; 0.33, 0.68, 0.51, 0.85, and 1.07 g/100 g of fatty acids) as well as trans-10, cis-12 CLA ({\textless}0.01, 0.01, {\textless}0.01, 0.02, and 0.02 g/100 g of fatty acids) were greater for diets 2 to 5 compared with diet 1. Molar proportions of ruminal acetate decreased and propionate increased for diets 2 to 5 compared with diet 1. The results showed that CCDS is as effective as DDGS in replacing soybean meal and corn grain in the total mixed ration.},

abstract = {Mycoplasma bovis and Mycoplasma agalactiae are two very closely related species which cause mastitis in cows and goats, respectively. M. bovis can also cause arthritis and respiratory disease in cattle. It has recently been shown that the 16S rRNA sequences differ only in 8 nucleotide positions between the two species [J.G. Mattsson, B. Guss and K.-E. Johansson (1994) FEMS Microbiol. Lett., 115 : 325-328]. These nucleotide differences are distributed over the molecule in such a way that it is difficult to design specific identification systems, based on PCR only, for M. bovis and M. agalactiae. Two different PCR systems based on 16S rRNA sequence data have, however, been designed for these two species. The forward primers were identical in the two systems and complementary to a segment of the evolutionarily variable region V2. The reverse primers were complementary to the variable region V6, in which there are two nucleotide differences between M. bovis and M. agalactiae. The size of the PCR products, generated with these primers, was 360 bp. Cross-amplification was obtained with the two species in the heterologous PCR systems, but with approximately a 100-fold lower efficiency. Cross-amplification was not obtained with any other bovine or caprine mycoplasma except for Mycoplasma sp. strain A1343 of the caprine group 7. The detection limit of the PCR system for M. bovis with a reference culture was 4 x 102 CFU/ml and of the PCR system for M. agalactiae 2 x 102 CFU/ml. The M. bovis-PCR system was used to analyze nasal samples of calves from a herd where an outbreak of pneumonia had occured and it proved possible to detect M. bovis in these samples.},

abstract = {Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is predominately associated with the detrimental effect of browning fruit and vegetables, however, interest within PPO containing forage crops (crops to be fed to animals) has grown since the browning reaction was associated with reduced nitrogen (N) losses in silo and the rumen. The reduction in protein breakdown in silo of red clover (high PPO forage) increased the quality of protein, improving N-use efficiency [feed N into product N (e.g., Milk): NUE] when fed to ruminants. A further benefit of red clover silage feeding is a significant reduction in lipolysis (cleaving of glycerol-based lipid) in silo and an increase in the deposition of beneficial C18 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in animal products, which has also been linked to PPO activity. PPOs protection of plant protein and glycerol based-PUFA in silo is related to the deactivation of plant proteases and lipases. This deactivation occurs through PPO catalyzing the conversion of diphenols to quinones which bind with cellular nucleophiles such as protein reforming a protein-bound phenol (PBP). If the protein is an enzyme (e.g., protease or lipase) the complexing denatures the enzyme. However, PPO is inactive in the anaerobic rumen and therefore any subsequent protection of plant protein and glycerol based-PUFA in the rumen must be as a result of events that occurred to the forage pre-ingestion. Reduced activity of plant proteases and lipases would have little effect on NUE and glycerol based-PUFA in the rumen due to the greater concentration of rumen microbial proteases and lipases. The mechanism for PPOs protection of plant protein in the rumen is a consequence of complexing plant protein, rather than protease deactivation per se. These complexed proteins reduce protein digestibility in the rumen and subsequently increase undegraded dietary protein flow to the small intestine. The mechanism for protecting glycerol-based PUFA has yet to be fully elucidated but may be associated with entrapment within PBP reducing access to microbial lipases or differences in rumen digestion kinetics of the forage and therefore not related to PPO activity.},

abstract = {In 1991 a new protein evaluation system replaced the Digestible Crude Protein (DCP) system in the Netherlands: the DVE/OEB-system. The system was mainly developed with the aim to prevent avoidable losses of nitrogen, by feeding according to more exactly defined requirements of dairy cows. A second aim was to predict milk protein production more accurately. Protein requirements for maintenance, milk protein production, growth, mobilisation, metabolic losses in the digestive tract and gestation are expressed in DVE, the sum of digestible feed and microbial true protein available in the small intestine. In the system each feed has a DVE-value composed of the digestible true protein contributed by feed protein escaping rumen degradation (1), microbial protein synthesized in the rumen (2) and a correction for endogenous protein losses in the digestive tract (3). Each feed also has a degraded protein balance (OEB) reflecting the difference between the potential microbial protein synthesis based on degraded feed crude protein and that based on energy available for microbial fermentation in the rumen. The framework of the new system is based on what are considered strong elements of other recently developed protein evaluation systems. Additionally new elements are introduced, including undegraded starch (USTA), fermentation products (FP) in ensiled feeds, the role of energy balance in protein supply and the way in which requirements change in the course of lactation. Data within the framework of the system are mainly of Dutch origin. This is particularly true for the regression equations developed to predict the protein values of forages and protein values of a number of by-product ingredients.},

abstract = {Cows milked in a pasture-based automatic milking system tend to have a lower daily milking frequency in comparison with cows milked in indoor systems. Milking events with intervals beyond 16h have been reported to have a negative effect on milk yield and udder health, and therefore it is important to minimize their occurrence. As feed is the main incentive to encourage cow traffic around the system, a study was conducted to compare pre- (PRE) versus postmilking (POST) supplementary feed placement strategies in a pasture-based automatic milking system. We hypothesized that PRE cows would have a stronger incentive to walk voluntarily from the paddock to the dairy facility to get milked (due to the reward being more immediate), thereby reducing their milking interval and increasing daily milking frequency and milk yield. The PRE cows returned to the dairy facility sooner (PRE=11.9 vs. POST=13.27h) but had longer milking intervals (PRE=15.3 vs. POST=14.28h). This was due to the additional time spent in the prefeeding area (PRE=56 versus POST=23min) combined with a longer average time spent in the premilking waiting yard (PRE=97 versus POST=77min). Treatment did not affect daily milk yield per cow. The result of this study demonstrates the potential of manipulating feeding management strategies to influence cow behavior and traffic in voluntary milking systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Genomic selection (GS) uses molecular
breeding values (MBV) derived from dense markers
across the entire genome for selection of young
animals. The accuracy of MBV prediction is important
for a successful application of GS. Recently,
several methods have been proposed to estimate
MBV. Initial simulation studies have shown that
these methods can accurately predict MBV. In this
study we compared the accuracies and possible bias
of five different regression methods in an empirical
application in dairy cattle.METHODS:Genotypes of
7,372 SNP and highly accurate EBV of 1,945 dairy
bulls were used to predict MBV for protein
percentage (PPT) and a profit index (Australian
Selection Index, ASI). Marker effects were estimated
by least squares regression (FR-LS), Bayesian
regression (Bayes-R), random regression best linear
unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), partial least squares
regression (PLSR) and nonparametric support vector
regression (SVR) in a training set of 1,239
bulls. Accuracy and bias of MBV prediction were
calculated from cross-validation of the training set
and tested against a test team of 706 young
bulls.RESULTS:For both traits, FR-LS using a subset
of SNP was significantly less accurate than all
other methods which used all SNP. Accuracies
obtained by Bayes-R, RR-BLUP, PLSR and SVR were very
similar for ASI (0.39-0.45) and for PPT
(0.55-0.61). Overall, SVR gave the highest accuracy.
All methods resulted in biased MBV predictions for
ASI, for PPT only RR-BLUP and SVR predictions were
unbiased. A significant decrease in accuracy of
prediction of ASI was seen in young test cohorts of
bulls compared to the accuracy derived from
cross-validation of the training set. This reduction
was not apparent for PPT. Combining MBV predictions
with pedigree based predictions gave 1.05 - 1.34
times higher accuracies compared to predictions
based on pedigree alone. Some methods have largely
different computational requirements, with PLSR and
RR-BLUP requiring the least computing
time.CONCLUSIONS:The four methods which use
information from all SNP namely RR-BLUP, Bayes-R,
PLSR and SVR generate similar accuracies of MBV
prediction for genomic selection, and their use in
the selection of immediate future generations in
dairy cattle will be comparable. The use of FR-LS in
genomic selection is not recommended. },

abstract = {The objective was to evaluate the effect of dietary phytate P (Pp) supply on ruminal and postruminal Pp digestion and net disappearance of P from the lower digestive tract of lactating cows. Six ruminally and ileally cannulated crossbred lactating cows were used in 2 incomplete Latin squares with four 21-d periods (17d of diet adaptation, 4d of total collection). Dietary treatments were low Pp, medium Pp, and high Pp, and a high inorganic P (Pi) diet with the same total P content as the highest Pp diet but with P mostly from inorganic sources. The diets contained 0.10, 0.18, 0.29, and 0.11{\%} Pp and 0.43, 0.48, 0.54, and 0.53{\%} total P on a dry matter basis, with cottonseed meal used to increase Pp content. Ytterbium-labeled corn silage and Co-EDTA were used as particulate and liquid phase markers to measure omasal and ileal digesta flow. Omasal and ileal digesta were collected every 6h on d 20 and 21 and rumen contents were collected on d 21. Samples were analyzed for total P (molybdovanadate yellow method), Pi (blue method), and Pp (high performance ion chromatography). Phytate P and total P intake increased linearly with increasing dietary Pp. Ruminal Pp disappearance also increased linearly with dietary Pp but the magnitude of change was small. Small intestinal net disappearance of Pi was not affected by dietary Pp. Phytate P was hydrolyzed in the large intestine but its hydrolysis was not influenced by dietary Pp. Net disappearance of Pi form the large intestine did not vary with dietary Pp. Dry matter digestibility decreased linearly with increasing dietary Pp, as did apparent digestion of P, and fecal P increased linearly. Dry matter digestibility was higher for high Pi than for high Pp, likely due to the effect of cottonseed meal in the latter diet. Replacing a portion of Pp with Pi resulted in decreased P excretion but this effect was confounded with increased fecal dry matter for the high-Pp (high-cottonseed meal) diet. In lactating cows Pp digestibility was not negatively influenced by dietary Pp and fecal P excretion was regulated by dietary total P rather than by form of dietary P.},

abstract = {A brown midrib (BMR) hybrid and a silage-specific non-BMR (7511FQ) hybrid were harvested at a normal cut height leaving 10 to 15 cm of stalk in the field. The non-BMR hybrid was also cut at a greater height leaving 45 to 50 cm of stalk. Cutting high increased the concentrations of dry matter (+4{\%}), crude protein (+5{\%}), net energy for lactation (+3{\%}), and starch (+7{\%}), but decreased the concentrations of acid detergent fiber (-9{\%}), neutral detergent fiber (-8{\%}), and acid detergent lignin (-13{\%}) for 7511FQ. As expected, the BMR corn silage was 30{\%} lower in lignin concentration than 7511FQ. After 30 h of in vitro ruminal fermentation, the digestibility of neutral detergent fiber for normal cut 7511FQ, the same hybrid cut high, and the normal cut BMR hybrid were 51.7, 51.4, and 63.5{\%}, respectively. Twenty-seven multiparous lactating cows were fed a total mixed ration composed of the respective silages (45{\%} of dry matter) with alfalfa haylage (5{\%}), alfalfa hay (5{\%}), and concentrate (45{\%}) (to make the TMR isocaloric and isonitrogenous) in a study with a 3 x 3 Latin square design with 21-d periods. Milk production was greater for cows fed the BMR hybrid (48.8 kg/d) compared with those fed the normal cut 7511FQ (46.8 kg/d) or cut high (47.7 kg/d). Dry matter intake was not affected by treatment. Feed efficiency for cows fed the BMR silage (1.83) was greater than for those fed high-cut 7511FQ (1.75), but was not different from cows fed the normal cut 7511FQ (1.77). Cows fed the BMR silage had milk with greater concentrations of lactose but lower milk urea nitrogen than cows on other treatments. Harvesting a silage-specific, non-BMR corn hybrid at a high harvest height improved its nutritive content, but the improvement in feeding value was not equivalent to that found when cows were fed BMR corn silage.},

abstract = {{\{}T{\}}he epigenetic phenomenon of genomic imprinting provides an additional
level of gene regulation that is confined to a limited number of
genes, frequently, but not exclusively, important for embryonic development.
{\{}T{\}}he evolution and maintenance of imprinting has been linked to
the balance between the allocation of maternal resources to the developing
fetus and the mother's well being. {\{}G{\}}enes that are imprinted in
both the embryo and extraembryonic tissues show extensive conservation
between a mouse and a human. {\{}H{\}}ere we examine the human orthologues
of mouse genes imprinted only in the placenta, assaying allele-specific
expression and epigenetic modifications. {\{}T{\}}he genes from the domain
and the isolated human orthologues of the imprinted genes and all
are expressed biallelically in the human, from first-trimester trophoblast
through to term. {\{}T{\}}his lack of imprinting is independent of promoter
{\{}C{\}}p{\{}G{\}} methylation and correlates with the absence of the allelic
histone modifications dimethylation of lysine-9 residue of {\{}H{\}}3 ({\{}H{\}}3{\{}K{\}}9me2)
and trimethylation of lysine-27 residue of {\{}H{\}}3 ({\{}H{\}}3{\{}K{\}}27me3). {\{}T{\}}hese
specific histone modifications are thought to contribute toward regulation
of imprinting in the mouse. {\{}G{\}}enes from the domain show polymorphic
concordant expression in the placenta, with imprinting demonstrated
in only a minority of samples. {\{}T{\}}ogether these findings have important
implications for understanding the evolution of mammalian genomic
imprinting. {\{}B{\}}ecause most human pregnancies are singletons, this
absence of competition might explain the comparatively relaxed need
in the human for placental-specific imprinting. },

Dairy cows were injected with vitamin E and selenium (Se) in one study; beef cows were offered oral vitamin E supplementation via a free-choice vitamin- mineral mix in two studies. Breed-related effects were also evaluated. Jerseys had higher blood Se and lower serum vitamin E concentrations than Holsteins at dry-off and higher blood Se concentrations than Holsteins 3-4 weeks pre-calving and at calving. Selenium supplementation increased blood Se concentrations at calving. Treatment did not affect serum vitamin E concentrations at calving or post-calving, nor blood Se concentrations post-calving. Beef cattle consuming supplemental vitamin E (treatment) had greater responses to treatment when calving in late winter than when calving in late summer. Treated multiparous cows calving in winter had increased serum and colostral vitamin E concentrations but treatment did not affect colostral or serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations of their calves. Calves from treated, multiparous cows calving in winter had increased 205-day adjusted weaning weights (AWWs). Treatment did not affect colostral vitamin E or IgG concentrations of nulliparous heifers calving in winter, nor serum vitamin E or IgG concentrations, or AWWs of their calves. Six hundred IU supplemental vitamin E/head/day did not affect serum vitamin E concentrations of dams, colostral vitamin E or IgG concentrations, serum vitamin E or IgG concentrations, or growth of calves in the summer-calving herd. Breed-related differences in vitamin E concentrations and AWW occurred in both herds. Consumption of 600-1000 IU vitamin E/cow/day (treatment) during late gestation via a free-choice vitamin-mineral mix increased vitamin E concentrations in serum and the lipoprotein fraction containing no apolipoprotein B (non-ApoB) from 1-2 weeks pre-calving to calving.

abstract = {Many studies have shown the beneficial effects on ruminant performance of feeding them with silages inoculated with lactic acid bacteria (LAB). These benefits might derive from probiotic effects. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether LAB included in inoculants for silage can survive in rumen fluid (RF), as the first step in studying their probiotic effects. Experiments were conducted in the United States and Israel with clarified (CRF) and strained RF (SRF) that were inoculated at 10(6)-10(8) microorganisms/mL with and without glucose at 5 g/L. RF with no inoculants served as control. Ten commercial inoculants were used. The RF was incubated at 39 degrees C and sampled in duplicates at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h for pH and LAB counts. The results indicate that with glucose the pH of the RF decreased during the incubation period. In the SRF, the pH of the inoculated samples was higher than that of the controls in most cases.

in one sex displaces the other sex from its phenotypic optimum. {\{}I{\}}t
arises because many shared traits have a common genetic basis but
undergo contrasting selection in the sexes. {\{}A{\}} recent surge of interest
in this evolutionary tug of war has yielded evidence of such conflicts
in laboratory and natural populations. {\{}H{\}}ere we highlight outstanding
questions about the causes and consequences of intralocus sexual
conflict at the genomic level, and its long-term implications for
sexual coevolution. {\{}W{\}}hereas recent thinking has focussed on the
role of intralocus sexual conflict as a brake on sexual coevolution,
we urge a broader appraisal that also takes account of its potential
to drive adaptive evolution and speciation.},

abstract = {Supplemental glycerol inhibits rumen lipolysis, a prerequisite for rumen biohydrogenation, which is responsible for the saturation of dietary fatty acids consumed by ruminant animals. Feeding excess glycerol, however, adversely affects dry matter digestibility. To more clearly define the effect of supplemental glycerol on rumen lipolysis, mixed populations of ruminal bacteria were incubated with 6 or 20{\%} glycerol (vol/vol). After 48-h anaerobic incubation of mixed culture rumen fluid, rates of free fatty acid production (nmol/mL per h) for the 6 and 20{\%} glycerol-supplemented samples were decreased by 80 and 86{\%}, respectively, compared with rates from nonsupplemented control cultures (12.4±1.0; mean ± SE). Conversely, assay of the prominent ruminal lipase-producing bacteria Anaerovibrio lipolyticus 5S, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, and Propionibacterium species avidum and acnes revealed no effect of 2 or 10{\%} (vol/vol) added glycerol on lipolytic activity by these organisms. Supplementing glycerol at 6{\%} on a vol/vol basis, equivalent to supplementing glycerol at approximately 8 to 15{\%} of diet dry matter, effectively reduced lipolysis. However, the mechanism of glycerol inhibition of ruminal lipolysis remains to be demonstrated.},

abstract = {This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of decreasing dietary protein and rumen-undegradable protein (RUP) on production performance, nitrogen retention, and nutrient digestibility in high-producing Holstein cows in early lactation. Twelve multiparous Holstein lactating cows (2 lactations; 50 ± 7 d in milk; 47 kg/d of milk production) were used in a Latin square design with 4 treatments and 3 replicates (cows). Treatments 1 to 4 consisted of diets containing 18, 17.2, 16.4, and 15.6{\%} crude protein (CP), respectively, with the 18{\%} CP diet considered the control group. Rumen-degradable protein levels were constant across the treatments (approximately 10.9{\%} on a dry matter basis), whereas RUP was gradually decreased. All diets were calculated to supply a postruminal Lys:Met ratio of about 3:1. Dietary CP had no significant effects on milk production or milk composition. In fact, 16.4{\%} dietary CP compared with 18{\%} dietary CP led to higher milk production; however, this effect was not significant. Feed intake was higher for 16.4{\%} CP than for 18{\%} CP (25.7 vs. 24.3 kg/d). Control cows had greater CP and RUP intakes, which resulted in higher concentrations of plasma urea nitrogen and milk urea nitrogen; cows receiving 16.4 and 15.6{\%} CP, respectively, exhibited lower concentrations of milk urea nitrogen (15.2 and 15.1 vs. 17.3 mg/dL). The control diet had a significant effect on predicted urinary N. Higher CP digestibility was recorded for 18{\%} CP compared with the other diets. Decreasing CP and RUP to 15.6 and 4.6{\%} of dietary dry matter, respectively, had no negative effects on milk production or composition when the amounts of Lys and Met and the Lys:Met ratio were balanced. Furthermore, decreasing CP and RUP to 16.4 and 5.4{\%}, respectively, increased dry matter intake.},

abstract = {AIMS: To determine the effect of Propionibacterium acidipropionici, alone or in combination with Lactobacillus plantarum, on the fermentation and aerobic stability of wheat, sorghum and maize silages.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The inoculants were applied at 1.0 x 10(6) CFU g(-1). Silages with no additives served as control. Fresh forages were sampled prior to ensiling. Three jars per treatment were sampled on days 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 after ensiling, for chemical and microbiological analysis. At the end of the ensiling period, the silages were subjected to an aerobic stability test. The P. acidipropionici-inoculated silages had significantly higher levels of acetic and propionic acid than the L. plantarum or P. acidipropionici + L. plantarum-inoculated silages (P {\textless} 0.05). Therefore, yeast activity was impaired in the P. acidipropionici-inoculated silages. As a result, P. acidipropionici decreased CO(2) production and improved aerobic stability of wheat, sorghum and maize silages. However, the combination of P. acidipropionici + L. plantarum did not improve aerobic stability of the silages.

CONCLUSIONS: The P. acidipropionici was very effective in protecting the wheat, sorghum and maize silages exposed to air under laboratory conditions, probably because the acidic environment under ensiling conditions is favourable for this micro-organism.

SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of P. acidipropionici, as a silage inoculant can improve the aerobic stability of silages by inhibition of yeast activity.},

abstract = {Feeding strategies of transition dairy cows contribute to the risk factors associated with metabolic disorders that limit production in the ensuing lactation. To investigate the effects of prepartum dietary crude protein (CP) concentration and amount of rumen-undegradable protein (RUP) on postpartum health and production, 44 multiparous Holstein cows were blocked by expected calving date and assigned to one of four isoenergetic prepartum rations beginning 28 d prior to expected calving date. Prepartum rations were: 12{\%} CP and 26{\%} RUP, 16{\%} CP and 26{\%} RUP, 16{\%} CP and 33{\%} RUP, or 16{\%} CP and 40{\%} RUP on a dry matter basis. All cows were fed the same postpartum diet (18{\%} CP, 40{\%} RUP) from 1 to 56 d in milk (DIM). Prepartum dry matter intake (DMI) was not different among dietary treatments. Mean postpartum intakes (kg/d) were higher through 56 DIM (P{\textless}0.05) for cows fed the 12{\%} CP:26{\%} RUP diet prepartum compared with any of the 16{\%} CP diets (21.8 vs. 19.8, 18.6 and 18.6; 12{\%} CP:26{\%} RUP vs. 16{\%} CP:26{\%} RUP, 16{\%} CP:33{\%} RUP and 16{\%} CP:40{\%} RUP). There was a DIM x prepartum diet interaction (P{\textless}0.05) with the greatest effect of the 12{\%} CP:26{\%} RUP diet evident during the first 35 DIM. Cows fed the 12{\%} CP:26{\%} diet during the transition period tended to produce more milk (kg/d) (P = 0.08) than did cows fed any of the 16{\%} CP diets (40.8 versus 37.8, 38.7, and 37.4; 12{\%} CP:26{\%} RUP vs. 16{\%} CP:26{\%} RUP, 16{\%} CP:33{\%} RUP, and 16{\%} CP:40{\%} RUP). Additional protein (12 vs. 16{\%} CP) in the prepartum diet tended to decrease milk protein (P = 0.10) and milk fat yield (P = 0.08) but did not alter percent milk fat, percent milk protein, or MUN. Liver triglyceride (TG) expressed as milligrams of TG per microgram of DNA or percentage of dry matter (DM) on d -28, -14, +1, +28, and +56 relative to calving were not significantly different among treatments. Maximal (P{\textless}0.05) infiltration of TG in liver was observed on +1 d when expressed as a percentage of DM and on +28 d when expressed as milligrams of TG per microgram of DNA. Plasma glucose, calcium, urea nitrogen, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and nonesterified fatty acids were not different (P{\textless}0.05) among treatments. The data indicate carryover effects of prepartum dietary protein on postpartum intake and milk production, pointing to beneficial effects of maintaining dietary protein for dairy cows in late gestation at 12{\%} CP.},

abstract = {The influence of Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract (Amaferm) on in vitro fiber degradation was determined by incubating eight ground fibrous feed-stuffs with rumen fluid and buffer inoculum. Amaferm was added at 0, .4, .8, or 1.2 g/L of fermentation mixture. Both NDF and ADF degradabilities were determined after 96 h of incubation. Addition of extract had no effect on NDF or ADF degradability of pure cellulose, low endophyte fescue, wheat straw, corn silage, or prairie hay. Addition of Amaferm at .8 or 1.2 g/L increased NDF and ADF degradations of bromegrass hay and alfalfa hay; its addition at .4 or .8 g/L, but not at 1.2 g/L, increased NDF and ADF degradation of high endophyte fescue hay. In a second set of in vitro fermentations, selective antimicrobials (penicillin, streptomycin, and cycloheximide) were used to assess the influence of Amaferm on various microbial groups. The enhanced fiber degradation by Amaferm was attributed to its stimulation of bacterial activity because its addition to whole rumen fluid without or with cycloheximide increased fiber digestion. In contrast, addition of Amaferm to the whole rumen fluid plus penicillin and streptomycin treatment had no effect on fiber degradation, suggesting that fungal or protozoal activity was not affected by treatment. In conclusion, Amaferm increased fiber digestibility of certain feedstuffs, and the increase was mediated via stimulation of rumen bacterial, but not fungal or protozoal, activities.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this Research Paper we hypothesised that the temporary insulin resistance seen during the transition period in dairy cows may cause significant differences in the efficacy of PG at different sampling periods and that in some cases this effect will be dose dependent. Eighty four sampling sets were generated by studying 7 multiparous Holstein cows repeatedly at 4 sampling periods of 3 d length (dry cows: days 40, 39 and 38 antepartum; close up cows: days 10, 9 and 8 antepartum; fresh cows: days 3, 4 and 5 post-partum; lactating cows: days 38, 39 and 40 post-partum). On each of these days 3 h after morning feeding propylene glycol was drenched in different dosages of 100, 300 or 500 ml once per day (cross over study). The different doses were applied in an alternating order (Latin square). Blood samples were taken before, every 30 min up to 4 h, after 6 and 12 h after PG application. Following parameters have been measured: insulin, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), betahydroxybutyrate (BHB), bilirubin, cholesterol, potassium, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH). Revised Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (RQUICKI) was calculated. It was found that glucose, insulin, NEFA, BHB, bilirubin and potassium concentrations were influenced differently by the three defined dosages of propylene glycol at four different sampling periods. Whereas RQUICKI, cholesterol, AST and GLDH did not differ between the sampling periods and treatments. The major results of the study are that the effect of PG is dose-dependent and that the effect of PG is depending on the time of application according to calving. It can be concluded that in fresh cows higher dosages are necessary to provoke similar effects in comparison to dry, close up and lactating cows. Although the study did not compare to topdressing of PG from the results it is reasonable to believe that bolus application of a specific PG volume is necessary to provoke the effect.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Two Latin square trials, using 21 or 24 multiparous lactating Holstein cows, compared the feeding value of red clover and alfalfa silages harvested over 2 yr. Red clover silages averaged 2 percentage units lower in crude protein (CP) and more than 2 percentage units lower in neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber than did alfalfa silage. In trial 1, diets were formulated to 60{\%} dry matter (DM) from alfalfa, red clover silage, or alfalfa plus red clover silage (grown together); CP was adjusted to about 16.5{\%} by adding soybean meal, and the balance of dietary DM was from ground high moisture ear corn. Nonprotein N in red clover and al-falfa-red clover silages was 80{\%} of that in alfalfa silage. Although DM intake was 2.5 and 1.3 kg/d lower on red clover and alfalfa plus red clover, yield of milk and milk components was not different among diets. In trial 2, four diets containing rolled high moisture shelled corn were formulated to 60{\%} DM from alfalfa or red clover silage, or 48{\%} DM from alfalfa or red clover silage plus 12{\%} DM from corn silage. The first three diets contained 2.9{\%} soybean meal, and the red clover-corn silage diet contained 5.6{\%} soybean meal; the 60{\%} alfalfa diet con-tained 18.4{\%} CP, and the other three diets averaged 16.5{\%} CP. Nonprotein N in red clover silage was 62{\%} of that in alfalfa silage. Intake of DM was about 2 (no corn silage) and 1 kg/d (plus corn silage) lower on red clover. Yield of milk and milk components was not dif-ferent among the first three diets; however, yields of milk, total protein, and true protein were higher on red clover-corn silage with added soybean meal. Replacing alfalfa with red clover improved feed and N efficiency and apparent digestibility of DM, organic matter, neu- 1728 tral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and hemicellu-lose in both trials. Net energy of lactation computed from animal performance data was 18{\%} greater in red clover than alfalfa. Data on milk and blood urea and N efficiency suggested better N utilization on red clover.

abstract = {Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is one of the most important metabolic disorders, traditionally characterized by low rumen pH, which might be induced by an increase in the dietary proportion of grains as well as by a reduction of structural fiber. Both approaches were used in earlier published experiments in which SARA was induced by replacing part of the ration by a grain mixture or alfalfa hay by alfalfa pellets. The main differences between both experiments were the presence of blood lipopolysaccharide and Escherichia coli and associated effects on the rumen microbial population in the rumen of grain-based induced SARA animals as well as a great amount of quickly fermentable carbohydrates in the grain-based SARA induction experiment. Both induction approaches changed rumen pH although the pH decrease was more substantial in the alfalfa-based SARA induction protocol. The goal of the current analysis was to assess whether both acidosis induction approaches provoked similar shifts in the milk fatty acid (FA) profile. Similar changes of the odd- and branched-chain FA and the C18 biohydrogenation intermediates were observed in the alfalfa-based SARA induction experiment and the grain-based SARA induction experiment, although they were more pronounced in the former. The proportion of trans-10 C18:1 in the last week of the alfalfa-based induction experiment was 6 times higher than the proportion measured during the control week. The main difference between both induction experiments under similar rumen pH changes was the decreasing sum of iso FA during the grain-based SARA induction experiment whereas the sum of iso FA remained stable during the alfalfa-based SARA induction experiment. The cellulolytic bacterial community seemed to be negatively affected by either the presence of E. coli and the associated lipopolysaccharide accumulation in the rumen or by the amount of starch and quickly fermentable carbohydrates in the diet. In general, changes in the milk FA profile were related to changes in rumen pH. Nevertheless, feed characteristics (low in structural fiber vs. high in starch) also affected the milk FA profile and, as such, both effects should be taken into account when subacute acidosis occurs.},

abstract = {The composition and functional capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocyte populations from dairy cows are altered substantially during the peripartal period. These changes are associated with a heightened susceptibility of the mammary gland to infection. It has been postulated that the metabolic demands associated with lactogenesis may impact negatively leukocyte function during the periparturient period. In the present study, serum immunoglobulin G1 concentration and functional capacities of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes from intact (n = 6) and mastectomized (n = 6) periparturient Jersey cows were evaluated and compared. Cell function assessments included lymphocyte proliferation, immunoglobulin M secretion, and interferon-gamma secretion by unstimulated and pokeweed mitogen stimulated mononuclear leukocytes. Data were summarized as mean responses for 5-d periods beginning 21 d prepartum and concluding at 19 d postpartum. The progressive decrease in serum immunoglobulin G in intact but not mastectomized cows before parturition likely was attributable to the selective uptake of this isotype by the mammary gland. Lymphocyte proliferation and secretion of interferon-gamma and polyclonal IgM by mitogen-stimulated leukocytes from intact cows decreased during the 15-d period before calving, reaching a nadir at 0 to 4 d postpartum. From 5 to 19 d postpartum, these functions often were comparable to those observed 2 to 3 wk prepartum. Functions of leukocytes from mastectomized cows did not change during the study period, although they often were of lower magnitude than those of cells from nonlactating cows. These results reconfirm the occurrence of a generalized reduction in blood mononuclear leukocyte function during the periparturient period. They also suggest that the reduction in leukocyte function during the period may be, in part, due to the physiologic demands imposed on the dairy cow by the lactating mammary gland.},

abstract = {The influence of Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract (Amaferm{\textregistered}) on in vitro fiber degradation was determined by incubating eight ground fibrous feedstuffs with rumen fluid and buffer inoculum. Amaferm{\textregistered} was added at 0, .4, .8, or 1.2g/L of fermentation mixture. Both NDF and ADF degradabilities were determined after 96h of incubation. Addition of extract had no effect on NDF or ADF degradability of pure cellulose, low endophyte fescue, wheat straw, corn silage, or prairie hay. Addition of Amaferm{\textregistered} at .8 or 1.2g/L increased NDF and ADF degradations of bromegrass hay and alfalfa hay; its addition at .4 or .8g/L, but not at 1.2g/L increased NDF and ADF degradation of high endophyte fescue hay. In a second set of in vitro fermentations, selective antimicrobials (penicillin, streptomycin, and cycloheximide) were used to assess the influence of Amaferm{\textregistered} on various microbial groups. The enhanced fiber degradation by Amaferm{\textregistered} was attributed to its stimulation of bacterial activity because its addition to whole rumen fluid without or with cycloheximide increased fiber digestion. In contrast, addition of Amaferm{\textregistered} to the whole rumen fluid plus penicillin and streptomycin treatment had no effect on fiber degradation, suggesting that fungal or protozoal activity was not affected by treatment. In conclusion, Amaferm{\textregistered} increased fiber digestibility of certain feedstuffs, and the increase was mediated via stimulation of rumen bacterial, but not fungal or protozoal activities.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of gradual replacement of a mixture of late-cut grass silage (LS) and barley with early-cut grass silage (ES) on milk production, CH4 emissions, and N utilization in Swedish Red cows. Two grass silages were prepared from the same primary growth of timothy grass sward but harvested 2 wk apart [11.0 and 9.7 MJ of metabolizable energy/kg of dry matter (DM)]. Four diets, fed as a total mixed ration, were formulated to meet the metabolizable energy and protein requirements of 35 kg of energy-corrected milk (ECM) by gradually replacing a mixture of LS and barley with ES (0, 33, 67, and 100{\%} of the forage component of the diet), whereas the proportion of barley decreased from 47.2 to 26.6{\%} of diet DM. Expeller canola meal was used as a protein supplement. Sixteen Swedish Red cows were used in 4 replicated 4 × 4 Latin squares. Cows were offered diets ad libitum and milked twice daily. Each period of 28 d comprised 14 d of diet adaptation followed by 14 d of data collection. Intake and milk yield were recorded daily, and milk samples were collected on d 19 to 21 and d 26 to 28 of each period. Diet digestibility was determined by grab sampling using indigestible neutral detergent fiber as an internal marker. Gas emissions were measured using the GreenFeed system (C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD). Dry matter intake (DMI) linearly decreased from 22.6 to 19.3 kg/d as the proportion of ES increased in the diet. The ECM yield did not differ among treatments, but milk protein yield decreased with increasing proportion of ES in the diet. Because of reduced DMI with increasing ES, feed efficiency (ECM/DMI) improved with an increased proportion of ES in the diet. Nitrogen efficiency (milk N/N intake) did not change despite a linear increase in milk urea N concentration from 9.7 (LS alone) to 11.9 mg/dL (ES alone) with graded replacement of LS and barley by ES in the diet. Lower DMI responses in ES diets were partly compensated for by increased organic matter digestibility (656 g/kg of DM for LS alone; 715 g/kg of DM for ES alone) related to improved forage digestibility at early harvesting. Total CH4 emissions and CH4 intensity (CH4/ECM) were not influenced by diet, but CH4 yield (CH4/DMI) increased linearly from 19.5 to 23.0 g/kg of DMI with greater inclusion of ES in the diet. In conclusion, replacing LS and barley with ES improved the conversion of feed to milk without increasing CH4 emissions or compromising N efficiency.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In genomic selection, a model for
prediction of genome-wide breeding value (GBV) is
constructed by estimating a large number of SNP
effects that are included in a model. Two Bayesian
methods based on MCMC algorithm, Bayesian shrinkage
regression (BSR) method and stochastic search
variable selection (SSVS) method, (which are called
BayesA and BayesB, respectively, in some
literatures), have been so far proposed for the
estimation of SNP effects. However, much
computational burden is imposed on the MCMC-based
Bayesian methods. A method with both high computing
efficiency and prediction accuracy is desired to be
developed for practical use of genomic
selection.RESULTS:EM algorithm applicable for BSR is
described. Subsequently, we propose a new EM-based
Bayesian method, called wBSR (weighted BSR), which
is a modification of BSR incorporating a weight for
each SNP according to the strength of its
association to a trait. Simulation experiments show
that the computational time is much reduced with
wBSR based on EM algorithm and the accuracy in
predicting GBV is improved by wBSR in comparison
with BSR based on MCMC algorithm. However, the
accuracy of predicted GBV with wBSR is inferior to
that with SSVS based on MCMC algorithm which is
currently considered to be a method of choice for
genomic selection.CONCLUSIONS:EM-based wBSR method
proposed in this study is much advantageous over
MCMC-based Bayesian methods in computational time
and can predict GBV more accurately than MCMC-based
BSR. Therefore, wBSR is considered a practical
method for genomic selection with a large number of
SNP markers.},

abstract = {The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the effects of the substitution of a protein source by canola meal (CM) on lactational responses (CM minus control) in dairy cows. The study included 49 comparisons of isonitrogenous (±1.0{\%} dietary CP content) dietary treatments published since 1975 (27 experiments). The CM intake ranged from 1.0 to 4.0kg/d (standard deviation = 0.65). Regressions were forced through the origin, weighted by sample size, and controlled for changes in dry matter intake and in dietary concentrations of CP and ether extract. Milk yield and milk protein yield responded positively to the substitution of a protein source by CM. The response in milk protein yield was affected by the type of protein source that was substituted; the positive response was half less when CM was substituted for soybean meal compared with substitution of CM for other protein sources. The latter effect was in part related to a positive response on milk protein percentage when CM replaced protein sources other than soybean meal. The response in efficiency of N utilization (milk N yield/N intake) was positive to the substitution of a protein source by CM. Negative changes in supply of metabolizable protein (MP) estimated from the 2001 National Research Council model were associated with positive responses in milk protein yield with CM substitution, a finding contrary to the expected positive relationship between supply of MP and milk protein yield. In conclusion, a protein supplement can be substituted by CM with positive effects on milk and milk protein production. These data also indicate an underestimation of MP supply associated with CM inclusion in dairy rations using the National Research Council model.},

abstract = {This study examined the effects of a forage source [wheat straw (WS) versus grass hay (GH)] prepartum and supplemental carbohydrate source [corn (dry feed; DF) versus molasses (liquid feed; LF)] on pre- and postpartum intake, digestibility, selective particle consumption, milk yield, and lipid metabolism. The objectives were to determine if forage or pre- and postpartum supplement alters periparturient intake, energy balance, and milk yield. Sixty (n = 15) multiparous dairy cows were used in a randomized complete block design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments to compare WS versus GH diets supplemented with either DF or LF. Dietary treatments were (1) WS prepartum + DF pre- and postpartum (WSDF), 2) WS prepartum + LF pre- and postpartum (WSLF), (3) GH prepartum + DF pre- and postpartum (GHDF), and (4) GH prepartum + LF pre- and postpartum (GHLF). Treatments began at dry-off, 42 d before expected calving. During the prepartum phase, cows maintained dry matter intake (DMI) at 2.0{\%} of body weight and prepartum energy balance remained positive for all treatments until calving. Prepartum GH diets had a more positive energy balance compared with WS diets. On week -5, energy balance was more positive for GHDF than for WSDF or GHLF. Energy balance for WSLF, however, was lower on week -3 and -1 than GHDF. Liquid feed decreased dry matter digestibility and increased prepartum liver triglyceride, serum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and tended to increase $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate. After calving, LF decreased DMI and energy balance, but not yield of milk or 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk, resulting in greater feed efficiency compared with DF. Forage did not affect postpartum DMI, but milk yield tended to be higher for WS versus GH. The DMI expressed as percentage of body weight was not affected by supplement or prepartum forage type. Cows fed WS had lower serum NEFA, higher liver glycogen, and tended to have a lower triglyceride to glycogen ratio postpartum than GH. Serum NEFA peaked on d 14 for all treatments and then declined thereafter. In postpartum diets, more particles were retained on the top screen for LF ({\textgreater}19.0 mm) of the Penn State Particle Separator, which also tended to have more particles in the second screen (particles 19.0-8.0 mm). Supplement had minimal effect on postpartum selective particle consumption. In conclusion, feeding diets containing WS resulted in lower postpartum serum NEFA, higher liver glycogen, and a tendency for greater milk production and lower liver triglyceride to glycogen than those containing GH. Liquid feed reduced postpartum DMI but not yield of milk yield or 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk yield, resulting in an improvement in feed efficiency. Future research should continue to investigate the use of single dry cow diet feeding strategies as they affect pre- and postpartum animal responses.},

The stepwise replacement of hay by barley decreased dietary biotin and the net output of biotin by the microbial metabolism. It is concluded that rumen microbes utilise more and/or synthesize less biotin with increasing proportions of dietary barley. These results indicate that a critical reconsideration of current views with regard to the supply and requirement of the high yielding dairy cow for biotin is necessary.},

abstract = {
A 3-part study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a developmental fibrolytic enzyme additive on the digestibility of selected forages and the production performance of early-lactation dairy cows. In part 1, 4 replicate 24-h batch culture in vitro incubations were conducted with alfalfa hay, alfalfa silage, and barley silage as substrates and ruminal fluid as the inoculum. A developmental fibrolytic enzyme additive (AB Vista, Marlborough, UK) was added at 5 doses: 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 [mu]L/g of forage dry matter (DM). After the 24-h incubation, DM, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) disappearance were determined. For alfalfa hay, DM, NDF, and ADF disappearance was greater at the highest dosage compared with no enzyme addition. Barley silage NDF and ADF and alfalfa silage NDF disappearance tended to be greater for the highest enzyme dosage compared with no enzyme addition. In part 2, 6 ruminally cannulated, lactating Holstein dairy cows were used to determine in situ degradation of alfalfa and barley silage, with (1.0 mL/kg of silage DM) and without added enzyme. Three cows received a control diet (no enzyme added) and the other 3 received an enzyme-supplemented (1.0 mL/kg of diet DM) diet. Enzyme addition after the 24 h in situ incubation did not affect the disappearance of barley silage or alfalfa silage. In part 3, 60 early-lactation Holstein dairy cows were fed 1 of 3 diets for a 10-wk period: (1) control (CTL; no enzyme), (2) low enzyme (CTL treated with 0.5 mL of enzyme/kg of diet DM), and (3) high enzyme (CTL treated with 1.0 mL of enzyme/kg of diet DM). Adding enzyme to the diet had no effect on milk yield, but dry matter intake was lower for the high enzyme treatment and tended to be lower for the low enzyme treatment compared with CTL. Consequently, milk production efficiency (kg of 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk/kg of DM intake) linearly increased with increasing enzyme addition. Cows fed the low and high enzyme diets were 5.3 (not statistically significant) and 11.3{\%} more efficient, respectively, compared with CTL cows. This developmental fibrolytic enzyme additive has the potential to increase fiber digestibility of forages, which could lead to greater milk production efficiency for dairy cows in early lactation.},

abstract = {Objectives of the current study were to estimate genetic parameters in Holstein cows for energy balance (EB) and related traits including dry matter intake (DMI), body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), energy-corrected milk (ECM) production, and gross feed efficiency (GFE), defined as the ratio of total ECM yield to total DMI over the first 150 d of lactation. Data were recorded for the first half of lactation on 227 and 175 cows in their first or later lactation, respectively. Random regression models were fitted to longitudinal data. Also, each trait was averaged over monthly intervals and analyzed by single and multivariate animal models. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.27 to 0.63, 0.12 to 0.62, 0.12 to 0.49, 0.63 to 0.72, and 0.49 to 0.53 for DMI, ECM yield, EB, BW, and BCS, respectively, averaged over monthly intervals. Daily heritability estimates ranged from 0.18 to 0.30, 0.10 to 0.26, 0.07 to 0.22, 0.43 to 0.67, and 0.25 to 0.38 for DMI, ECM yield, EB, BW, and BCS, respectively. Estimated heritability for GFE was 0.32. The genetic correlation of EB at 10d in milk (DIM) with EB at 150 DIM was -0.19, suggesting the genetic regulation of this trait differs by stage of lactation. Positive genetic correlations were found among DMI, ECM yield, and BW averaged over monthly intervals, whereas correlations of these traits with BCS depended upon stage of lactation. Total ECM yield for the lactation was positively correlated with DMI, but a negative genetic correlation between total ECM yield and EB was found. However, the genetic correlation between total ECM yield and EB in the first month of lactation was -0.02, indicating that total production is not genetically correlated with EB during the first month of lactation, when negative EB is most closely associated with diminished fitness. The genetic correlation between GFE and EB ranged from -0.73 to -0.99, indicating that selection for more efficient cows would favor a lower energy status. However, the genetic correlation between EB in the first month of lactation and GFE calculated from 75 to 150 DIM was not significant, indicating that the unfavorable correlation between GFE and EB in early lactation may be minimized with alternative definitions of efficiency. Thus, EB, GFE and related traits will likely respond to genetic selection in Holstein cows. However, the impact of selection for improved feed efficiency on EB must be carefully considered to avoid potential negative consequences of further reductions in EB at the onset of lactation.},

abstract = {A review of the systemic acute phase reaction with major cytokines involved, and the hepatic metabolic changes, negative and positive acute phase proteins (APPs) with function and associated pathology is given. It appears that APPs represent appropriate analytes for assessment of animal health. Whereas they represent non-specific markers as biological effect reactants, they can be used for assessing nutritional deficits and reactive processes, especially when positive and negative acute phase variables are combined in an index. When such acute phase index is applied to separate healthy animals from animals with some disease, much better results are obtained than with single analytes and statistically acceptable results for culling individual animals may be reached. Unfortunately at present no cheap, comprehensive and easy to use system is available for assessing various acute phase proteins in serum or blood samples at the same time. Protein microarray or fluid phase microchip technology may satisfy this need; and permit simultaneous analysis of numerous analytes in the same small volume sample and enable integration of information derived from systemic reactivity and nutrition with disease specific variables. Applying such technology may help to solve health problems in various countries not only in animal husbandry but also in human populations.},

Multiparous Israeli-Holstein dry cows (n = 44) at 256 d of pregnancy were assigned to 2 treatments: (1) control cows were fed prepartum a dry-cow diet and postpartum a lactating-cow diet that consisted of 5.8{\%} ether extracts; and (2) extruded flaxseed (EF) cows were supplemented prepartum with 1 kg of extruded flaxseed (7.9{\%} dry matter)/cow per d, and postpartum were fed a diet containing 9.2{\%} of the same supplement. The EF supplement was fed until 100 d in milk. On average, each pre- and postpartum EF cow consumed 160.9 and 376.2g of C18:3n-3/d, respectively. Postpartum dry matter intake was 3.8{\%} higher in the EF cows. Milk production was 6.4{\%} higher and fat content was 0.4{\%} U lower in the EF group than in the controls, with no differences in fat and protein yields. Energy balance in the EF cows was more positive than in the controls; however, no differences were observed in concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and glucose in plasma. Compared with controls, EF cows had greater proportions of C18:3n-3 in plasma and adipose tissue. The proportion of n-3 FA in milk fat was 3.7-fold higher in the EF cows, and the n-6:n-3 ratio was decreased from 8.3 in controls to 2.3 in the EF cows. Within-group tests revealed that the C18:3n-3 content in milk fat in the EF cows was negatively correlated with milk fat percentage (r = -0.91) and yield (r = -0.89). However, no decrease in de novo synthesis of less than 16-carbon FA was found in the EF group, whereas C16:0 yields were markedly decreased. It appears that the enrichment of C18:3n-3 in milk fat was limited to approximately 2{\%}, and the potential for increasing this n-3 FA in milk is higher for cows with lower milk fat contents. In conclusion, feeding increased amounts of C18:3n-3 during the transition period enhanced dry matter intake postpartum, increased milk production, decreased milk fat content, and improved energy balance. Increased amounts of EF considerably influenced the FA profile of plasma, adipose tissue, and milk fat. However, the extent of C18:3n-3 enrichment in milk fat was limited and was negatively correlated with milk fat content and yield.},

At d 21 following parturition, 18 cows fed the unsupplemented diet were switched to diets containing 0 or .3 ppm supplemental Se and 0 or 40 IU/kg supplemental vitamin E arranged factorially. These diets were fed for the next 32 d. The remaining cows continued their respective diets for 32 d. Plasma Se concentrations averaged .1 microgram/ml for supplemented cows but were .05 micrograms/ml for unsupplemented cows. Plasma Se concentration from cows fed supplemental Se from 21 to 53 d postpartum increased rapidly and were not different from long-term supplemented cows. Whole blood glutathione peroxidase activity was lower in unsupplemented than in supplemented cows. Short-term Se supplementation increased glutathione peroxidase activity above that for unsupplemented animals, but activity was still less than that in long-term supplemented animals. Plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations at parturition and d 21 postpartum were lower in unsupplemented than in supplemented animals. On d 53 postpartum, no differences in plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations were found between long-term supplemented and unsupplemented cows.

Little is known regarding Cr concentrations naturally present in practical feed ingredients. The present study was conducted to determine Cr concentrations in feed ingredients commonly fed to ruminants. Feed ingredients were collected from dairy farms, feed mills, grain bins, and university research farms. Mean Cr concentrations in whole cereal grains ranged from 0.025 mg/kg of DM for oats to 0.041 mg/kg of DM for wheat. Grinding whole samples of corn, soybeans, and wheat through a stainless steel Wiley mill screen greatly increased analyzed Cr concentrations. Harvested forages had greater Cr concentrations than concentrates, and alfalfa hay or haylage had greater Cr concentrations than grass hay or corn silage. Chromium in alfalfa hay or haylage (n = 13) averaged 0.522 mg/kg of DM, with a range of 0.199 to 0.889 mg/kg of DM. Corn silage (n = 21) averaged 0.220 mg of Cr/kg of DM with a range of 0.105 to 0.441 mg of Cr/kg of DM. By-product feeds ranged from 0.040 mg of Cr/kg of DM for cottonseed hulls to 1.222 mg of Cr/kg of DM for beet pulp. Of the feed ingredients analyzed, feed grade phosphate sources had the greatest Cr concentration (135.0 mg/kg). Most ruminant feedstuffs and feed ingredients had less than 0.50 mg of Cr/kg of DM. Much of the analyzed total Cr in feed ingredients appears to be due to Cr contamination from soil or metal contact during harvesting, processing, or both.},

{\{}MJ{\}}/d at the intercept of the lactation curve at 1 day in milk ({\{}DIM{\}}),
but the effect of choline on milk protein yield gradually decreased

yield was increased from 1.13 to 1.26�kg/d at the intercept of the
lactation curve at 1 {\{}DIM{\}}, but the effect of choline on milk protein
yield gradually decreased during the course of the study. {\{}C{\}}holine
supplementation was associated with decreased milk fat concentration
at the intercept of the lactation curve at 1 {\{}DIM{\}}, but the effect
of choline on milk fat concentration gradually decreased as lactation
progressed. {\{}C{\}}holine supplementation had no effect on energy-corrected
milk yield, energy balance, body weight, body condition score, and
measured blood parameters. {\{}C{\}}holine supplementation decreased the

Multiparous Holstein cows (n = 31) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments beginning 9 +/- 6 d before expected calving and ceased at 40 d in milk (DIM): 1) 578 g/d of a rumen-inert (RI) palm fatty acid distillate (control), 2) 600 g/d of RI-CLA for the entire trial period (CLA-1), and 3) 600 g/d of RI-CLA until 10 DIM followed by 200 g/d for the remainder of the trial (CLA-2). Each dose provided equal amounts of fatty acids by replacing and balancing each treatment with a RI palm fatty acid distillate. Doses provided a total of 522 g of fatty acids/ d and 0, 174, or 58 (depending upon DIM) g of CLA (mixed isomers)/d. To improve palatability, doses were mixed with 600 g/d of dried molasses; one-half of the supplement was fed at 0800 h, and the remainder at 1900 h. Individual milk yield, dry matter intake, and body weight were recorded daily and milk composition determined every other day. There was no overall CLA effect on either the content or yield of milk protein or lactose. Both CLA treatments decreased overall milk fat content (26.0 and 18.3{\%}) and yield (22.5 and 17.3{\%}) with CLA-induced milk fat depression becoming significant by d 8. The CLA-induced milk fat depression increased in magnitude with progressing DIM until reaching a plateau on d 18 for CLA-1 (43{\%}) and on d 14 for CLA-2 (33{\%}), although neither milk fat trans-10, cis-12 CLA content (1.8 mg/g) nor its transfer efficiency (6.3{\%}) changed over time. Treatments had no effect on overall dry matter intake or milk yield, but there was a treatment x time interaction for milk production, as cows fed either CLA treatment had increased milk yield after the second week of lactation. Cows fed either CLA treatment had a significant improvement in overall EBAL (-5.1 vs. -1.8 Mcal/d), a decrease in nonesterified fatty acid levels (12{\%}), and an increase in glucose levels (11{\%}). A dietary supplement containing trans-10, cis-12 CLA markedly improves EBAL and bioenergetic variables and increases milk yield in the total mixed ration-fed transitioning dairy cow.},

abstract = {The objective of this work was to assess the effect of timing of feed delivery on the behavior and productivity of cows milked 3 times per day. Twelve lactating Holstein dairy cows (4 primiparous and 8 multiparous), milked 3 times per day (at 1400, 2100, and 0700 h), were individually assigned and exposed to each of 2 treatments (over 21-d periods) in a replicated crossover design. Treatments were the manipulation of timing of TMR delivery, 2 times per day, in relation to milking time: (1) feeding at milking time (at 1400 and 0700 h), and (2) feeding halfway between milking times (at 1730 and 1030 h). Milk production, feeding, sorting, and rumination behavior were monitored for each animal for the last 7d of each treatment period. Milk samples were collected for 2 of the last 4d of each period for milk component analysis. With a feed delivery delay, dry matter intake (DMI) tended to be lower (26.5 vs. 27.2kg/d). Although no difference was found in feeding time (224.2min/d), cows fed with a delay consumed their feed more slowly (0.12 vs. 0.13kg of dry matter/min) in more frequent meals (10.0 vs. 9.1 meals/d), which were smaller in size (2.8 vs. 3.1kg/meal) and tended to be shorter in duration (26.7 vs. 30.1min/meal). Cows fed at milking sorted for long particles (102.3{\%}), whereas cows fed with a delay did not sort for or against those particles. Cows sorted for medium particles to a similar extent (102.5{\%}) on each treatment. Cows did not sort for or against short particles on either treatment. Sorting against fine particles was observed, to a similar extent (97.1{\%}), on both treatments. Rumination time (8.9 h/d) and lying time (9.5 h/d) were similar between treatments. Cows without fresh feed at the 1400h milking tended to stand for less time following that milking (71.0 vs. 94.0min), whereas cows without fresh feed at the 0700h milking stood for less time following that milking (66.3 vs. 87.8min). No difference in this latency to lie down was seen at the 2100h milking. Milk yield (48.0kg/d), milk fat content (3.64{\%}), and milk protein content (2.86{\%}) were similar between treatments. Given the tendency for a difference in DMI and no change in yield, efficiency of production was improved with a feed delay (1.93 vs. 1.80kg of milk/kg of DMI). These data suggest that moving the timing of feed delivery resulted in cows consuming their feed more slowly in smaller, more frequent meals, contributing to an improvement in efficiency of production.},

abstract = {We explore the theoretical consequences of limiting
selection to males for the evolution of imprinted
genes. We find that the efficiency of male-limited
selection depends on the pattern of imprinting at an
imprinted locus. When selection is strong, the
maternally expressed pattern of imprinting allows
faster genetic change than the reciprocal,
paternally expressed pattern. When selection is
relatively weak, the pattern of imprinting that
permits a greater rate of genetic response to
selection depends on the frequency of the favored
allele: the paternally expressed pattern permits
faster genetic change than does the maternally
expressed pattern at low frequencies of a favored
allele; at higher frequencies of a favored allele,
however, the maternally expressed pattern is again
more conducive to a genetic response. To our
knowledge, this is the first theoretical description
of a difference between the two reciprocal patterns
of imprinting. The selective efficiency bias we
identify between the two patterns of imprinting has
implications for natural and livestock populations,
which we discuss. },

Eight control calves were fed a diet in which untreated rolled barley was substituted for alkali-treated grain. Calves receiving NaOH-treated barley became polyuric with urine pH ranging from 9.0 to 9.5, and had significantly raised plasma creatinine levels on day 29. Other clinical findings were normal, and there were no other significant alterations in blood. At necropsy, bilateral renal lesions consisted of white cortical foci, medullary stippling, and the presence of uroliths in the renal papillae and calyces. Microscopic changes included tubular dilatation, atrophy, necrosis, and mineralization, interstitial fibrosis with mononuclear cell invasion and consequent glomerular changes. It appeared that glomerular and interstitial changes were secondary to primary tubular damage. No abnormalities were detected in control calves. Feeding of NaOH-treated barley can result in nephrotoxicosis in cattle.},

abstract = {Mycotoxin mixtures are associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections in mature cattle. STEC are considered commensal bacteria in mature cattle suggesting that mycotoxins provide a mechanism that converts this bacterium to an opportunistic pathogen. In this study, we assessed the mycotoxin content of hemorrhaged mucosa in dairy calves during natural disease outbreaks, compared the virulence genes of the STECs, evaluated the effect of the mucosal mycotoxins on STEC toxin expression and evaluated a Celmanax{\textregistered}/Dairyman's Choice™ application to alleviate disease. As for human infections, the OI-122 encoded nleB gene was common to STEC genotypes eliciting serious disease. Low levels of aflatoxin (1–3 ppb) and fumonisin (50–350 ppb) were detected in the hemorrhaged mucosa. Growth of the STECs with the mycotoxins altered the secreted protein concentration with a corresponding increase in cytotoxicity. Changes in intracellular calcium indicated that the mycotoxins increased enterotoxin and pore-forming toxin activity. A prebiotic/probiotic application eliminated the morbidity and mortality losses associated with the STEC infections. Our study demonstrates: the same STEC disease complex exists for immature and mature cattle; the significance of the OI-122 pathogenicity island to virulence; the significance of mycotoxins to STEC toxin activity; and, finally, provides further evidence that prebiotic/probiotic applications alleviate STEC shedding and mycotoxin/STEC interactions that lead to disease.},

abstract = {There has been limited effort to examine condensed tannin (CT) concentrations of forage legume species grown in western Canada. Using the butanol-HCl technique, extractable CT concentrations were measured in Trifolium hybridum L., T. ambiguum M. Bieb, T. pratense L., T. repens L., Dalea purpurea Vent., Onobrychis viciifolia Scop., Lotus corniculatus L., Medicago sativa L., and Astragalus cicer L. collected from research and variety trial plots across the Canadian prairies. Above ground plant biomass was harvested at the vegetative and mature physiological stages for two growing seasons. Dalea purpurea, a native legume, had the highest mean CT concentration of 68.6922.6 g kg?1 DM, with minimum and maximum values ranging from 37.9 to 92.9 g kg?1 DM. Onobrychis viciifolia had the second highest mean CT concentration (46.0 g kg?1 DM) with a range of 16.3 to 94.4 g kg?1 DM. The third highest mean CT concentration of 15.1 g kg?1DMwas found in L. corniculatus with a range of 0.0 to 25.7 g kg?1 DM. Forage biomass had higher CT concentrations (PB0.05) when harvested at the mature stage for all species except O. viciifolia, which had higher CT concentrations in the vegetative state. The potential benefit of inclusion of these species in ruminant diets at the observed concentrations requires further exploration.},

abstract = {The effects of fat supplements that differed in fatty acid composition (chain length and degree of saturation) and chemical form (free fatty acids, Ca salts of fatty acids, and triacylglyceride) on digestible energy (DE) concentration of the diet and DE intake by lactating cows were measured. Holstein cows were fed a control diet [2.9{\%} of dry matter (DM) as long-chain fatty acids] or 1 of 3 diets with 3{\%} added fatty acids (that mainly replaced starch). The 3 fat supplements were (1) mostly saturated (C18:0) free fatty acids (SFA), (2) Ca-salts of fatty acids (CaFA), and (3) triacylglyceride high in C16:0 fatty acids (TAG). Cows fed CaFA (22.8 kg/d) consumed less DM than cows fed the control (23.6 kg/d) and TAG (23.8 kg/d) diets but similar to cows fed SFA (23.2 kg/d). Cows fed fat produced more fat-corrected milk than cows fed the control diet (38.2 vs. 41.1 kg/d), mostly because of increased milk fat percentage. No differences in yields of milk or milk components were observed among the fat-supplemented diets. Digestibility of DM, energy, carbohydrate fractions, and protein did not differ between diets. Digestibility of long-chain fatty acids was greatest for the CaFA diet (76.3{\%}), intermediate for the control and SFA diets (70.3{\%}), and least for the TAG diet (63.3{\%}). Fat-supplemented diets had more DE (2.93 Mcal/kg) than the control diet (2.83 Mcal/kg), and DE intake by cows fed supplemented diets was 1.6 Mcal/d greater than by cows fed the control, but no differences were observed among the supplements. Because the inclusion rate of supplemental fats is typically low, large differences in fatty acid digestibility may not translate into altered DE intake because of small differences in DM intake or digestibility of other nutrients.},

abstract = {A 4 x 4 Latin square experiment was conducted to examine abomasal passage of biogenic amines in steers fed silage and their related effects on intake, digestibility, and digestive function. Thirty percent of the dry matter (DM) in the diets consisted of alfalfa forage, which was fed as either hay or silage. The DM from alfalfa silage DM was substituted at 0, 33, 67, and 100{\%} for DM from alfalfa hay and was fed to four ruminally and abomasally cannulated steers. The roughage component of the diet constituted 50{\%} of the DM and consisted of 60{\%} alfalfa silage or hay and 40{\%} tropical corn silage. The concentrate was composed mainly of ground corn. The concentrations of putrescine and cadaverine in abomasal digesta increased as alfalfa silage in the diet increased. Abomasal recovery of biogenic amines, a product of their concentration in abomasal digesta and the passage of DM through the abomasum, was negatively correlated with intake. Abomasal recovery of most amines was 5 to 20{\%} of intake. Abomasal recovery of cadaverine was correlated with depressed intake. Total DM intake was reduced 8.3 to 25.8{\%} as the proportion of alfalfa silage in the diet increased. Frequency of reticular contractions, intake, ruminal DM digestibility, ruminal outflow, volatile fatty acids, and total tract DM digestibility decreased in steers fed diets that contained more alfalfa silage. Ruminal fluid pH and NH3 concentration increased in steers fed more alfalfa silage; however, mass and the DM percentage of ruminal contents decreased linearly. Postprandial insulin concentrations were quadratically related to the proportion of alfalfa hay or silage in the diet. Intraruminal metabolism of biogenic amines is extensive based on the relatively low quantities recovered in abomasal digesta; however, the amounts recovered in abomasal digesta were related to intake depression and associated physiological effects.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiology of subclinical ketosis (SCK) in dairy cows in early lactation and determine the association of (1) days in milk (DIM) at onset of SCK, and (2) blood $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentration at onset of SCK with development of displaced abomasum (DA) and removal from herd in the first 30 DIM, conception to first service, days to conception within 150 DIM, and early lactation milk yield. Cows from 4 freestall dairy herds (2 in New York and 2 in Wisconsin) were each tested 6 times for SCK from 3 to 16 DIM using the Precision Xtra meter (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Subclinical ketosis was defined as a BHBA concentration of 1.2 to 2.9 mmol/L. Mixed-effects multivariable Poisson regression was used to assess DA, removal from herd, and conception to first service. Semiparametric proportional hazards models were used to evaluate days to conception, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to evaluate milk yield in the first 30 DIM. A total of 741 of 1,717 (43.2{\%}) eligible cows had a least one BHBA test of 1.2 to 2.9 mmol/L. Peak incidence of SCK occurred at 5 DIM, when 22.3{\%} of cows had their first SCK-positive test. Peak prevalence of SCK occurred at 5 DIM, when 28.9{\%} of cows had a SCK-positive test. Median time from first positive SCK test until BHBA test {\textless}1.2 mmol/L was 5d. Cows first testing SCK positive from 3 to 5 DIM were 6.1 times more likely [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 2.3 to 16.0] to develop a DA than cows first testing SCK positive at 6 DIM or later. Cows first testing SCK positive from 3 to 7 DIM were 4.5 times more likely (95{\%} CI = 1.7 to 11.7) to be removed from the herd, were 0.7 times as likely (95{\%} CI = 0.6 to 0.8) to conceive to first service, and produced 2.2 kg less milk per day for the first 30 DIM than cows first testing positive at 8 DIM or later. Each 0.1 mmol/L increase in BHBA at first SCK-positive test increased the risk of developing a DA by a factor of 1.1 (95{\%} CI = 1.0 to 1.2), increased the risk of removal from herd by a factor of 1.4 (95{\%} CI = 1.1 to 1.8), and was associated with a decrease in milk production by 0.5 kg/d for the first 30 DIM. These results show that time of onset and BHBA concentration of first SCK-positive test are important indicators of individual cow performance.},

abstract = {$\beta$-Glucans are major cell wall structural components in fungi. As they are not found in animals, these carbohydrates are considered to be classic pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and are recognized by the innate immune system. Although their immunomodulating activities have been shown to be associated with the recognition of some fungi, and with their medicinal properties in the field of cancer immunotherapy, it is still unclear how $\beta$-glucans mediate their effects. Recent studies have started to shed some light on their cellular receptors, such as dectin-1, and their molecular mechanisms of action. We have extensively investigated the response of leukocytes to $\beta$-glucan, focusing on cytokine induction by SCG, which is a major 6-branched 1,3-$\beta$-d-glucan in Sparassis crispa Fr. There is a strain difference in the reactivity of mice to SCG, and DBA/1 and DBA/2 mice are highly sensitive strains. In the process of research on cytokine induction by SCG in DBA/2 mice, we found that GM-CSF plays a key biological role in this activity. Cytokine induction by SCG was completely abolished in dendritic cells from dectin-1 knockout mice. On the other hand, controlling the level of endogenous GM-CSF production and/or dectin-1 expression could regulate the reactivity to $\beta$-glucan. These results indicate that the key factors in the responsiveness to $\beta$-glucan are GM-CSF production and dectin-1 expression. In this review, we describe how the key molecules related to the expression of the immunomodulating activities of $\beta$-glucan were identified, and how the response to $\beta$-glucan is controlled. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The NEL of calcium salts of long-chain fatty acids from palm oil was determined in mature Holstein cows. Twelve lactating (fed for ad libitum intake) and six nonlactating (restricted to near maintenance intake) Holstein cows were fed 0 or 2.95{\%} fat supplement in diets formulated to contain 16 or 20{\%} CP in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments in a single reversal design within protein level. The fat supplement was substituted for ground corn and minerals. Two 6-d total collection balance trials were conducted during which cows were in open circuit respiration chambers. Intake of OM was lower for lactating cows fed the fat supplement (18.1 vs. 19.1 kg/d), but energy intake did not differ (93.2 Mcal/d). Total long-chain fatty acid intake was increased from 477 to 820 g/d with fat feeding. Apparent digestibility of long-chain fatty acids was increased 11.1 percentage units with increased dietary CP for lactating cows with no difference in fatty acid digestibility for the dry cows. Milk yield was higher (34.3 vs. 32.0 kg/d) with fat feeding, but milk energy yield did not differ (22.6 Mcal/d). The NEL of the fat supplement was estimated from the incremental differences in energy values within cows, assuming NEL of corn replaced by fat to be 1.96 Mcal/kg DM, and was determined to be 6.52 Mcal/kg DM (SE = 1.74). The efficiency of the use of metabolizable energy for lactation from dietary fat was 77.2{\%}. The energy in calcium salts of long-chain fatty acids is utilized efficiently for lactation in mature cows.},

abstract = {This study investigated red clover polyphenol oxidase (PPO), its: activity, activation from latent into active form, and whether grazing at different levels of herbage maturity could result in sufficient PPO activation to protect proteins and glycerol-based lipid in the rumen. Wild-type red clover with high PPO activity and a mutant red clover with low PPO activity were used in five experiments. Firstly to investigate activation of the latent red clover PPO enzyme either through: protease, substrate (ortho-diphenols), cell damage or chemically (sodium dodecylsulphate detergent) induced mediation. Secondly PPO's activity at a range of pHs were determined to show how activation method altered the enzymes activity. Finally whether grazing could activate latent PPO and ultimately result in protected protein and glycerol-based lipid in the rumen was investigated. Incubation of extracted red clover PPO enzyme with a range of ortho-diphenols in the presence of oxygen resulted in rapid conversion of the latent to the active form of PPO. This conversion was blocked by the addition of ascorbic acid suggesting that this mechanism requires formation of ortho-quinones. Cell damage was highly correlated with activation of latent PPO and the formation of protein-bound phenols due to mixing of the chloroplastic enzyme with the vacuolar substrate (ortho-diphenols). The potential for PPO activity to occur during grazing was investigated by measuring the oxygen concentration in red clover boluses and within the rumen and PPO's effect on protein and glycerol-based lipid within red clover boluses. There was a rapid depletion of oxygen from the rumen, limiting the potential for PPO activation and activity to occur to the period of mastication. PPO was shown to be activated in both wild-type and mutant red clover boluses, however, factors such as fibre content and maturity of the red clover herbage (PPO concentration) altered the efficacy of PPO to produce phenol-bound protein. As a result greater protection of glycerol-based lipid in this study was achieved with a prior conditioning (wilting) of the red clover. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Legume forages have an important position in ruminant production in Western Europe and with further development can play an even larger role. Red clover for silage and white clover in grazed swards lead to enhanced growth rate and milk yield in comparison with pure grasses. Much of the production benefit of these legumes relates to enhanced intake since digestibilities are not markedly different to grasses. The higher intake of legume silages reflects differences in the cell structure of legume plants which combined with high fermentation rates means that they break down into small particles in the rumen, and leave the rumen more rapidly than perennial ryegrass. Ease of ingestion leads to high rates of intake, which explains higher intakes for grazed legumes. A further benefit of legumes is the reduced rate of decline in digestibility with advancing maturity. Whilst legumes have limited effects on gross milk composition or carcass characteristics, there are marked increases in levels of beneficial n-3 PUFA. Legumes have often led to a reduction in methane production from the rumen and again, this relates to both physical and chemical differences between forage species. The high rates of release of soluble protein and of breakdown to small particles from clovers and lucerne is associated with susceptibility to bloat, which is a limitation to further exploitation in grazing systems. The high concentration of rapidly degraded protein in legumes also leads to inefficient utilisation of dietary N and increased urinary N output. Research with tanniniferous forages, such as birdsfoot trefoil and sulla, demonstrates the potential for future legumes with reduced environmental and health effects, though these particular forage legumes are not well adapted to temperate regions of Western Europe that are the focus of this review.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the bene-fits of supplementation of mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) to cows during the last 3 wk of the dry period on immune function of the cows and subsequent transfer of passive immunity to their calves. Indicators of nonspe-cific and specific immunity were evaluated. Cows were vaccinated against rotavirus at 4 and 2 wk before ex-pected parturition. Blood samples were obtained from cows before vaccination and at weekly intervals until calving and from calves at birth and 24 h for analysis of serum protein concentrations, packed cell volume, white blood cell counts, white blood cell differentials, and serum rotavirus neutralization titers. Colostrum quantity and quality were measured at calving, and immunoglobulin isotype concentrations in colostrum were determined. Specific immunity was enhanced by MOS supplementation as evidenced by greater serum rotavirus neutralization titers at calving in cows sup-plemented with MOS compared with control cows. Co-lostral rotavirus neutralization titers were not affected by treatment. Although numerical differences appeared large, there was a high degree of variability in the colos-tral rotavirus neutralization titers. Calves from cows fed MOS tended to have greater serum rotavirus neu-tralization titers compared with calves from cows fed the control diet. There was a tendency for greater in-creases in serum protein concentrations from birth to 24 h in calves from cows fed MOS compared with calves from cows fed the control diet. Results indicate that supplementation of MOS to cows during the dry period enhanced their immune response to rotavirus and tended to enhance the subsequent transfer of rotavirus antibodies to calves.

abstract = {The effects of dietary palmitic and stearic acids on feed intake, yields of milk and milk components, and feed efficiency of dairy cows were evaluated in an experiment with a crossover arrangement of treatments with a covariate period. Cows with a wide range of milk production (38 to 65kg/d) were used to determine if response to fat supplementation varied according to production level. Thirty-two Holstein cows (143±61d in milk) were assigned randomly to a treatment sequence within level of milk production. Treatments were diets supplemented (2{\%} of diet dry matter) with palmitic acid (PA; 97.9{\%} C16:0) or stearic acid (SA; 97.4{\%} C18:0). Treatment periods were 21d and cows were fed a nonfat supplemented diet for 14d immediately before the first treatment period. The final 4d of each period were used for sample and data collection. Milk production measured during the covariate period (preliminary milk yield) was used as the covariate. No interactions were detected between treatment and preliminary milk yield for the production response variables measured. Compared with SA, the PA treatment increased milk fat concentration (3.66 vs. 3.55{\%}) and yield (1.68 vs. 1.59kg/d), and 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk yield (47.5 vs. 45.6kg/d). Treatment did not affect dry matter intake, milk yield, milk protein yield, body weight, or body condition score. Milk protein concentration was lower for PA compared with SA treatment (3.24 vs. 3.29{\%}). The PA treatment increased feed efficiency (3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk yield/dry matter intake) compared with SA (1.48 vs. 1.40). The increase in milk fat yield by PA was entirely accounted for by a 24{\%} increase in 16-carbon fatty acid output into milk. Yields of de novo (3.2{\%}) and preformed fatty acids (2.9{\%}) were only slightly decreased by PA relative to SA. The PA treatment increased plasma concentration of nonesterified fatty acids (96.3 vs. 88.2$\mu$Eq/L) and glucose (56.6 vs. 55.7mg/dL) compared with SA, but insulin and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate were not altered by the treatments. Results demonstrate that palmitic acid is more effective than stearic acid in improving milk fat concentration and yield as well as efficiency of feed conversion to milk. Responses were independent of production level and without changes in body condition score or body weight. Further studies are required to test the consistency of these responses across different types of diets.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to test for effects of gametic imprinting on litter size in swine by estimating variances for parent-specific gametic effects. Data were 64,047 and 137,009 multiparous records of number born alive for the U.S. Landrace and Yorkshire breeds, respectively. The statistical model included fixed effects of parity number and herd, and random effects of herd-year-season, mate, permanent environment, animal (additive genetic), and either maternal or paternal gametes. A Bayesian approach that used Gibbs sampling to obtain posterior distributions was employed. To aid in the interpretation of results, the Landrace data structure was used to simulate data with and without effects of imprinting. Analyses of the simulated records indicated that the model applied was capable of detecting effects of imprinting when such effects were present. Small, but non-zero, estimates of gametic variances were obtained when no imprinting was simulated. Estimates of the proportion of total variance accounted for by paternally transmitted gametes were 0.8 and 0.9{\%} for Landrace and Yorkshires, respectively. These estimates were different from zero, but were similar to the results observed for data simulated without an imprinting effect. Corresponding results for maternally transmitted gametes were 1.6{\%} for Landrace and 0.8{\%} for Yorkshires. The estimate for Landrace was significantly greater than that observed for Yorkshires and for the simulations without a true effect and suggested the presence of a non-Mendelian genetic influence on litter size. Paternally imprinted genes are a plausible reason for the observed results. Assuming that the effect observed was due to paternal imprinting at a single biallelic locus, the substitution effect of the superior allele could be greater than 0.7 piglets per litter. Identification of a genetic marker for such an allele would be useful in marker-assisted selection of females. Other possible explanations exist for the increased gametic variance in the Landrace breed, but these explanations (such as maternal or cytoplasmic effects) may be less likely than paternal imprinting.},

abstract = {Ten lactating Holstein cows fitted with ruminal cannulas that were part of a larger feeding trial were blocked by days in milk into 2 groups and then randomly assigned to 1 of 2 incomplete 5 x 5 Latin squares. Diets contained [dry matter (DM) basis] 25{\%} alfalfa silage, 25{\%} corn silage, and 50{\%} concentrate. Rolled high-moisture shelled corn was replaced with solvent-extracted soybean meal to increase crude protein (CP) from 13.5{\%} to 15.0, 16.5, 17.9, and 19.4{\%} of DM. Each of the 4 experimental periods lasted 28 d with data and sample collection performed during the last 8 d. Digesta samples were collected from the omasum to quantify the ruminal outflow of different N fractions. Intake of DM was not affected but showed a quadratic trend with maxima of 23.9 kg/d at 16.5{\%} CP. Ruminal outflow of total bacterial nonammonia N (NAN) was not different among diets but a significant linear effect of dietary CP was detected for this variable. Bacterial efficiency (g of total bacterial NAN flow/kg of organic matter truly digested in the rumen) and omasal flows of dietary NAN and total NAN also showed positive linear responses to dietary CP. Total NAN flow increased from 574 g/d at 13.5{\%} CP to 688 g/d at 16.5{\%} CP but did not increase further with the feeding of more CP. Under the conditions of this study, 16.5{\%} of dietary CP appeared to be sufficient for maximal ruminal outflow of total bacterial NAN and total NAN.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to identify dietary factors that affect fermentation and efficiency of microbial crude protein (CP(M)) synthesis in the rumen in vitro. We used 16 total mixed, dairy cow rations with known digestibilities that varied in ingredient composition and nutrient content. Each ration was incubated in a Rusitec (n = 3) for 15 d, and fermentation of different fractions was assessed. Observed extents of fermentation in 24 h were 35 to 47{\%} for organic matter, 25 to 60{\%} for crude protein, 3 to 28{\%} for neutral detergent fiber, and 31 to 45{\%} for gross energy. Organic matter fermentation depended on the content of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber in the ration. We studied net synthesis of CP(M) using an 15N dilution technique and found that 7 d of continuous 15N application are needed to achieve an 15N enrichment plateau in the N of isolated microbes in this type of study. The efficiency of CP(M) synthesis was 141 to 286 g/kg of fermented organic matter or 4.9 to 11.1 g/MJ of metabolizable energy, and these ranges agree with those found in the literature. Multiple regressions to predict the efficiency of CP(M) synthesis by diet data showed that crude protein was the only dietary chemical fraction that had a significant effect. Fat content and the inclusion rate of corn silage in the ration also tended to improve efficiency. We suggest that microbial need for preformed amino acids may explain the crude protein effect. A large part of the variation in efficiency of microbial activity still remains unexplained.},

abstract = {Holstein multiparous cows (n=29) and primiparous heifers (n=32) calving over a 1-yr period were subjected to photoperiod-melatonin treatments according to a 2×3 factorial design. Starting 8wk before expected calving, all animals were subjected to 1 of the following treatments: 8h of light and 16h of dark (8L:16D), 16h of light and 8h of dark (16L:8D), or 16L:8D plus melatonin feeding (16L:8D-melatonin). Each day at 1355h, the animals in the melatonin treatment received orally a gelatin capsule containing 25mg of melatonin. The treatments ended at calving, when the animals were moved to the lactation barn; all animals were then subjected to about 16h of light per day. At the beginning and end of the treatment period before calving, blood samples were taken from 6heifers and 6cows through a jugular cannula for 24h at 30-min intervals to monitor serum melatonin and prolactin concentrations. Milk production in the heifers was not affected by the photoperiod treatments. Early-lactation milk production was higher in the cows exposed to the short-day photoperiod than in those exposed to a long-day photoperiod (16L:8D and 16L:8D-melatonin), with averages of 36.7±0.9, 33.1±0.8, and 34.1±0.9kg/d for 8L:16D, 16L:8D, and 16L:8D-melatonin, respectively. Photoperiod had no effect on late-lactation milk production in the cows. During lactation, the dry matter intake of heifers was not affected by the treatments, but dry matter intake of the cows exposed to a short-day photoperiod was greater than that of the cows exposed to a long-day photoperiod. Feed efficiency of heifers was improved by short-day photoperiod. During the treatment period, prolactin concentration was lower in the animals exposed to a short-day photoperiod than in those exposed to a long-day photoperiod, was lower with the 16L:8D-melatonin treatment than with the 16L:8D treatment, and tended to be lower with the 8L:16D treatment than with the 16L:8D-melatonin treatment, with averages of 3.5±0.8, 9.9±0.8, and 6.0±0.8ng/mL for 8L:16D, 16L:8D, and 16L:8D-melatonin, respectively. In early lactation, prolactin concentration was lower in the heifers exposed to the 16L:8D photoperiod during the dry period than in those exposed to the 8L:16D photoperiod or fed melatonin. In conclusion, a short-day photoperiod during the dry period transiently increases milk production of cows and the feed efficiency of heifers in the following lactation. However, melatonin cannot be used to mimic a short-day photoperiod during the dry period.},

@article{christensen2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:The use of genomic selection in breeding
programs may increase the rate of genetic
improvement, reduce the generation time, and provide
higher accuracy of estimated breeding values
(EBVs). A number of different methods have been
developed for genomic prediction of breeding values,
but many of them assume that all animals have been
genotyped. In practice, not all animals are
genotyped, and the methods have to be adapted to
this situation.RESULTS:In this paper we provide an
extension of a linear mixed model method for genomic
prediction to the situation with non-genotyped
animals. The model specifies that a breeding value
is the sum of a genomic and a polygenic genetic
random effect, where genomic genetic random effects
are correlated with a genomic relationship matrix
constructed from markers and the polygenic genetic
random effects are correlated with the usual
relationship matrix. The extension of the model to
non-genotyped animals is made by using the pedigree
to derive an extension of the genomic relationship
matrix to non-genotyped animals. As a result, in the
extended model the estimated breeding values are
obtained by blending the information used to compute
traditional EBVs and the information used to compute
purely genomic EBVs. Parameters in the model are
estimated using average information REML and
estimated breeding values are best linear unbiased
predictions (BLUPs). The method is illustrated using
a simulated data set.CONCLUSIONS:The extension of
the method to non-genotyped animals presented in
this paper makes it possible to integrate all the
genomic, pedigree and phenotype information into a
one-step procedure for genomic prediction. Such a
one-step procedure results in more accurate
estimated breeding values and has the potential to
become the standard tool for genomic prediction of
breeding values in future practical evaluations in
pig and cattle breeding. },

abstract = {Degradation in the rumen of dairy cows of nitrogenous compounds in 35 grass silages and 12 grass hays was studied by means of the nylon bag incubation technique. Silages varied in dry matter content, crude protein content and date of harvesting; hays varied mainly in crude protein content. Measurements in both forages were washable (W), degradable (D) and undegradable fraction (U) and rate of degradation (ks) of D. W and U were measured as the residue after washing without incubating (W) or after 336 h in the rumen (U). N escape (E) was calculated from these data, assuming a ruminal passage rate of 4.5{\%} per hour. E (N escape from the rumen) in hays was substantially higher than in silages, mainly because a large proportion of N compounds in silage became soluble during the ensiling process. Of the total variation in E, around 80{\%} could be explained in both forages. In silage, E was positively influenced by dry matter content, negatively by crude protein content and positively by the number of days elapsed since 1 April. This effect of day of harvesting was mainly through an increase of U and may not be beneficial to the animal. In hays crude protein content was the major factor explaining variation in E},

abstract = {Four multiparous Holstein cows in midlactation were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square to evaluate whether source of forage influenced salivary secretion during eating in lactating dairy cows. The forages were allocated separately from the pelleted concentrates. Cows were offered 1 of 4 forages each period: barley silage, alfalfa silage, long-stemmed alfalfa hay, or chopped barley straw. Saliva secretion was measured during the morning meal by collecting masticates through the rumen cannula at the cardia of each cow. Rate of salivation (213 g/min) was not affected by forage source. However, the forage sources differed in eating rate (g of DM/min), which led to differences in ensalivation of forages (g of saliva/g of DM and g of saliva/g of NDF). On the basis of DM, ensalivation (g of saliva/g of DM) was greatest for straw (7.23) and similar for barley silage, alfalfa silage, and alfalfa hay (4.15, 3.40, and 4.34 g/g of DM, respectively). Higher ensalivation of straw could be accounted for by its higher neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content; ensalivation of NDF (g of saliva/g of NDF) was actually greatest for long-stemmed alfalfa hay (12.4) and similar for the other chopped forages (8.9). Cows consumed concentrate about 3 to 12 times faster than the various forages (DM basis), and ensalivation of concentrate was much lower (1.12 g of saliva/g of DM) than for forages. Feed characteristics such as particle size, DM, and NDF content affect salivary output during eating by affecting the eating rate.

The experimental material comprised 32 lambs aged 30 ± 3 days, divided into two equal groups: control and experimental. Experimental group animals were fed a diet supplemented with the Biolex-MB40 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in the amount of 3 g/kg of the concentrate. At the beginning of the experiment (day 0) and on experimental days 15, 30 and 60, blood was sampled from the jugular vein to determine and compare the phagocytic activity (PHAGOTEST) and oxidative metabolism (BURSTTEST) of peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes by flow cytometry. Based on the results of an analysis of granulocyte and monocyte phagocytic activity, statistically higher levels of phagocytic activity were observed in the group of lambs administered Biolex-MB40 than in the control animals, expressed in terms of the percentage of phagocytic cells as well as mean fluorescence intensity. Biolex-MB40 also had a positive effect on the oxidative metabolism of both granulocytes and monocytes after stimulation with Escherichia coli bacteria and with PMA (4-phorbol-12-$\beta$-myristate-13-acetate), expressed in terms of the percentage of oxidative metabolism as well as mean fluorescence intensity{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {High-fiber byproducts are generated by several industries, and the supplies of some of these nonforage fiber sources (NFFS) are increasing. Although NFFS generally have limited utility in nonruminant diets, dairy cattle nutritionists can use these products to partially replace both forages and concentrates in lactation diets. Research has shown that production responses vary, but under certain conditions, NFFS-based diets can maintain or improve performance of dairy cattle. Traditional dietary formulation strategies are not ideal when formulating diets to contain large concentrations of NFFS. When feeding high levels of NFFS (≥15{\%} inclusion rates, dry matter basis), less physically effective fiber is required; however, determining if this requirement has been met can be challenging, mainly because of the lack of a broadly applicable method for quantifying effective fiber in the field. Nutritionists must also be conscious of the nutrient variation that exists among many NFFS. Strategies to reduce risks associated with this variability include purchasing feed from a sole supplier who demonstrates product consistency and combining multiple NFFS at lower inclusion rates. A targeted approach whereby nonforage fiber primarily replaces some forage fiber for higher-producing cows but partially replaces some starch for lower-producing cows can optimize nutrient utilization without sacrificing animal health. In summary, the judicious use of NFFS represents an opportunity to improve the productivity and health of cattle in all stages of lactation while potentially controlling feed costs.},

abstract = {We present a Bayesian method that combines linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LDL) information for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. This method uses jointly all marker information (haplotypes) and all available pedigree information; i.e., it is not restricted to any specific experimental design and it is not required that phases are known. Infinitesimal genetic effects or environmental noise ("fixed") effects can equally be fitted. A diallelic QTL is assumed and both additive and dominant effects can be estimated. We have implemented a combined Gibbs/Metropolis-Hastings sampling to obtain the marginal posterior distributions of the parameters of interest. We have also implemented a Bayesian variant of usual disequilibrium measures like D' and r(2) between QTL and markers. We illustrate the method with simulated data in "simple" (two-generation full-sib families) and "complex" (four-generation) pedigrees. We compared the estimates with and without using linkage disequilibrium information. In general, using LDL resulted in estimates of QTL position that were much better than linkage-only estimates when there was complete disequilibrium between the mutant QTL allele and the marker. This advantage, however, decreased when the association was only partial. In all cases, additive and dominant effects were estimated accurately either with or without disequilibrium information.},

Necropsy of 10 cows revealed hemorrhages on the intestinal serosa and epicardium, lymphadenopathy, interstitial nephritis, small intestinal hemorrhage, and interstitial pneumonia. Histopathology showed lymphocytic to lymphogranulomatous inflammation in the heart, spleen, kidney, lymph nodes, liver, lung, pancreas, and adrenal gland. Phlebitis was present in 2 livers. The lesions resembled those of hairy vetch toxicosis, but no vetch was being fed. Similar lesions have been reported with the feeding of citrus pulp. Citrus pulp was being fed to the lactating cows and had been added to the diet 6 weeks before the first death. The syndrome resolved with elimination of citrus pulp from the diet.},

Twenty commercial farms were monitored over a period of 12 months. The feed at each farm and the silages used in its ration were sampled monthly for proximal analysis and for volatile fatty acid analysis. A total of 2857 urine samples were taken from 1112 cows to examine the ketonuria from about 30 days prepartum to 100 postpartum. Wide variation was recorded in the quality of silages used in the preparation of diets. Approximately 80{\%} of the urine samples analyzed had no detectable ketone bodies, 16{\%} returned values indicative of slight SCK, and the remainder, 4{\%}, showed symptoms of ketosis. Most of the cases of hyperkenuria were associated with the butyric acid content of the silage used (r (2) = 0.56; P {\textless} 0.05). As the metabolizable energy content of the feed was similar, no relationship was observed between the proportion of cows with SCK and the energy content of the feed. In our study, the probability of dairy cows suffering SCK is higher when they are eating feed made from silage with a high butyric acid content (35.2 g/kg DM intake).},

abstract = {Wheat straw was treated with anhydrous NH3 at 0, 1.75 or 3.50{\%} of dry matter (DM) and then with SO2 (0, 2, 3, 4 and 5{\%} DM) for either 3 or 7 days. Dry matter degradability (DMD) was measured using an in situ nylon bag technique. Nitrogen retention and DMD of the wheat straw was increased by the ammoniation (P {\textless} 0.001, linear and quadratic) with a significant NH3 × SO2 interaction (P {\textless} 0.05). Main effects for SO2 also showed increased DMD and crude protein (CP) at 0, 2, 3, 4 and 5{\%} levels (P {\textless} 0.001). The 7 day treatment with SO2 resulted in increased DMD (62.0{\%} vs. 59.7{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). Two feeding trials were conducted with wheat straw treated with either NH3 alone or a combination of NH3 and SO2. In Study 1, growing beef heifers were fed: (a) untreated straw (US); (b) ammoniated straw (AS); (c) NH3 + SO2 treated straw; (d) NH3 + SO2 treated straw (43{\%} DM) and hay (57{\%} DM); (e) bromegrass hay (H) alone fed ad libitum. All heifers received 1.3 kg of supplement in two daily meals. Intake of NH3 + SO2 treated straw for the first 28 days was very low compared with AS (1.8 kg vs. 3.8 kg), resulting in severe weight loss (-600 g day-1). This treatment was replaced by a mixture of NH3 + SO2 treated straw (43{\%} DM) and haylage (57{\%} DM) for the rest of the trial (10 weeks). Ammoniation of wheat straw did not significantly increase DM intakes (DMI) compared with US (5.99 kg day-1 vs. 5.12 kg day-1, P {\textgreater} 0.05) but improved average daily gain (ADG) (510 g vs. 347 g, P {\textless} 0.02). Heifers fed NH3 + SO2 treated straw and either haylage or hay consumed more feed (7.27 kg day-1 and 8.07 kg day-1 vs. 5.99 kg day-1) and gained more weight (833 g day-1 and 816 g day-1 vs. 510 g day-1) than animals fed AS. Animals fed H had DMI and ADG values similar to those fed NH3 + SO2 treated straw and hay (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The second trial was done to determine the effects of chemical treatment of straw on ruminal function and fiber digestion. The diets, offered ad libitum with a supplement, were US, AS, NH3 + SO2 treated straw alone and with hay. There was no effect of diet on ruminal dilution rate. The DMD values of the US, AS, NH3 + SO2 treated straw, and H were 48{\%}, 58{\%}, 68{\%} and 62{\%}, respectively. When fed as the only forage, NH3 + SO2 treated straw resulted in anorexia and weight loss; however, when fed at 43{\%} of diet DM, feed intakes and weight gains of heifers were better than AS and similar to H. In summary, the combined use of NH3 and SO2 at ambient temperatures has potential as a practical method for treatment of wheat straw. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {To evaluate propylene glycol (PG) and glycerol (G) as potential treatments for ketosis, we conducted 2 experiments lasting 4 d each in which cows received one bolus infusion per day. Blood was collected before infusion, over 240min postinfusion, as well as 24 h postinfusion. Experiment 1 used 6 ruminally cannulated cows (26±7 d in milk) randomly assigned to 300-mL infusions of PG or G (both ≥99.5{\%} pure) in a crossover design experiment with 2 periods. Within each period, cows were assigned randomly to infusion site sequence: abomasum (A)-cranial reticulorumen (R) or the reverse, R-A. Glucose precursors were infused into the R to simulate drenching and the A to prevent metabolism by ruminal microbes. Glycerol infused in the A increased plasma glucose concentration the most (15.8mg/dL), followed by PG infused in the R (12.6mg/dL), PG infused in the A (9.11mg/dL), and G infused in the R (7.3mg/dL). Infusion of PG into the R increased plasma insulin and insulin area under the curve (AUC) the most compared with all other treatments (7.88 vs. 2.13$\mu$IU/mL and 321 vs. 31.9min×$\mu$IU/mL, respectively). Overall, PG decreased plasma BHBA concentration after infusion (-6.46 vs. -4.55mg/dL) and increased BHBA AUC (-1,055 vs. -558min ×mg/dL) compared with G. Plasma NEFA responses were not different among treatments. Experiment 2 used 8 ruminally cannulated cows (22±5 d in milk) randomly assigned to treatment sequence in a Latin square design experiment balanced for carryover effects. Treatments were 300mL of PG, 300mL of G, 600mL of G (2G), and 300mL of PG + 300mL of G (GPG), all infused into the R. Treatment contrasts compared PG with each treatment containing glycerol (G, 2G, and GPG). Propylene glycol increased plasma glucose (14.0 vs. 5.35mg/dL) and insulin (7.59 vs. 1.11$\mu$IU/mL) concentrations compared with G, but only tended to increase glucose and insulin concentrations compared with 2G. Propylene glycol increased AUC for glucose (1,444 vs. 94.3mg/dL) and insulin (326 vs. 6.58min×$\mu$IU/mL) compared with G, and tended to increase insulin AUC compared with 2G. Propylene glycol was not different from GPG for glucose, insulin, or BHBA responses. Propylene glycol decreased plasma BHBA concentration (-10.3 vs. -4.21mg/dL) and increased BHBA AUC (-1,578 vs. -1.42min ×mg/dL) compared with G, but not compared with 2G. In general, and compared with G, GPG decreased plasma NEFA concentrations after infusions and PG decreased plasma NEFA concentrations early but not late after infusions. We conclude that a 300-mL dose of PG is more effective at increasing plasma glucose concentration than G and at least as effective as 600mL of G or a combination of G and PG when administered in the cranial reticulorumen.},

Data were collected from 83 multiparous Holstein cows. Blood samples for PMN function determination were collected weekly from 1 week prior to calving (week -1) through 4 weeks after calving and again at 8 weeks after calving. Energy metabolites were measured and dry matter intake (DMI) was determined from weeks -2 to 5 to evaluate energy status of cows during the periparturient period. All cows were examined for uterine health disorders. Blood PMN killing ability was evaluated by determining myeloperoxidase activity and cytochrome c reduction activity in isolated blood PMN's. For cows that were diagnosed with puerperal metritis and subclinical (SC) endometritis and puerperal metritis, blood PMN functions were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) impaired during the periparturient period, compared to cows with normal uterine health. Cows with subclinical endometritis and puerperal metritis or SC endometritis also had significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher NEFA and significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) lower DMI during the periparturient period, and significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) higher BHBA during early lactation, compared to cows with normal uterine health. Neutrophil function was also significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) impaired in cows with peripartum negative energy balance, which was characterized by elevated blood levels of NEFA and decreased DMI. Decreased PMN function and energy balance were associated with uterine health disorders and the decreases in PMN function and energy balance occurred prior to parturition and prior to the detection of these uterine disorders. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The objectives of this presentation are to review results of our previous and on-going research with respect to the risk factors and consequences of poor reproductive performance in dairy cows, and to develop an economic framework to optimize decisions related to dairy cow reproductive performance. To make profitable breeding and replacement decisions, the farmer must account for factors including age, production level, lactation stage, pregnancy status, and disease history of the cows in the herd. Establishing the interrelationships among disease, milk yield, reproduction, and herd management is necessary for developing a decision model for disease treatment, insemination, and replacement. The data for the studies reviewed in this presentation incorporate health, production, and management components from Holsteins in the Northeast USA and Ayrshires from Finland. Data were analyzed using the Cornell Theory Center Supercomputer. The effect of risk factors on reproductive disorders was modeled with logistic regression, and on conception, insemination, and culling with survival analysis. The effect of reproductive disorders on milk yield was analyzed with mixed models. Economic optimization of reproductive performance was done with dynamic programming (DP). High milk yield, high parity, and calving in winter were risk factors for several reproductive disorders. These disorders, in turn, delayed insemination and conception in dairy cows, and some of them increased the risk of culling. Dystocia, retained placenta, and early metritis led to a short-term drop in milk production. High milk yield was not a major factor in delaying conception, except in first parity cows. However, higher yielders were more likely to be inseminated, and less likely to be culled. Non-pregnant cows had a higher risk of being culled. Reproductive performance of dairy cows influenced a herd's profitability, and good heat detection and conception rates provided opportunities for management control. It was not always economically advantageous to get cows pregnant as soon as possible, and there was no one optimal value for the calving interval length for all cows in a herd.},

abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to assess the effect of physical form of a starter feed with or without straw supplementation on growth performance of Holstein calves. In experiment 1, a total of 32 calves were randomly assigned at 7 d of age to texturized starter feed (containing rolled barley, corn, and oats) without straw, texturized starter feed with chopped straw, and pelleted starter feed with chopped straw. All calves were offered 4 L of pasteurized whole milk twice daily from 7 to 35 d of age, 2 L of milk twice daily from 36 to 42 d of age, and 2 L of milk from 43 to 49 d of age. Animals were weaned at 50 d of age, and the study finished when calves were 63 d old. In experiment 2, a total of 60 calves (8 d of age) were randomly assigned to texturized starter feed (containing whole corn) without straw, pelleted starter feed without straw, and pelleted starter feed with chopped straw. All calves were offered the same milk replacer (MR; 23{\%} crude protein and 19.5 fat) at 11{\%} dry matter concentration, 4 L/d of MR until 14 d of age, 6 L/d of MR from 14 to 37 d, 3 L/d of MR from 38 to 44 d, and 1.5 L/d of MR from 45 to 52 d of age. The experiment finished when calves were 58 d old (1 wk after weaning). Rumen liquid pH was measured after weaning. In both studies, calves were individually housed in pens on sawdust bedding and starter feed and chopped straw were offered free choice in separate buckets. In experiment 1, starter feed and straw intake and growth did not differ among treatments. However, calves receiving straw showed a greater rumen pH compared with those not receiving straw. In experiment 2, pelleted started feed supplemented with straw fostered an increase in solid feed intake (as percentage of body weight) compared with a pelleted or texturized starter feed without straw supplementation. However, calves that received the texturized starter feed containing whole corn had rumen pH similar to those fed a pelleted starter feed with straw. Feeding a texturized starter feed containing rolled barley, corn, and oats (with or without straw provision) was not able to maintain rumen pH or promote growth and intake compared with offering a pelleted starter feed with chopped straw. However, when whole corn was used in the texturized starter feed, rumen pH was equivalent to that obtained with a pelleted starter feed and straw supplementation.},

@article{Seboussi2016,
abstract = {Fertilization with Se improves forage organic Se concentration, but comparisons with other forms of Se supplementation in feeding lactating dairy cows are scarce. Our objective was to compare the effect of Se-enriched forages to dietary sources of inorganic and organic Se. Digestibility, retention, and balance were assessed by measuring Se concentrations in feces, urine, milk, and blood. The resulting effect on antioxidant status and lactation performance of dairy cows was also determined. High-Se silages (1.72 mg of Se/kg of DM) were produced following a spring application of 2.5 kg/ha of Selcote Ultra, whereas low-Se silages (0.05 mg of Se/kg of DM) were produced in the Se-unfertilized portion of the same fields. After a 77 ± 17 d period of Se depletion, 33 late-lactation primiparous Holstein cows were blocked and randomly assigned for 43 d to 1 of 4 experimental total mixed rations fed for ad libitum intake in an unbalanced randomized block design. Treatments consisted of 4 diets: control with low-Se silages, without Se supplement (0.12 ± 0.04 mg of Se/kg of DM); ISe with low-Se silages and inorganic Se (0.80 ± 0.14 mg of Se/kg of DM); YSe with low-Se silages and organic Se from yeast (0.70 ± 0.11 mg of Se/kg of DM); and FSe with high-Se silages, without Se supplement (0.79 ± 0.14 mg of Se/kg of DM). Organic Se, either as YSe or FSe, was more available and more effective to increase blood and milk Se concentrations than ISe. Moreover, FSe was more available than YSe, as cows fed FSe excreted 16 and 22{\%} less Se (as percentage of intake) in feces and urine, respectively, had higher Se apparent absorption (17{\%}), retention (37{\%}), and balance (45{\%}), and had greater concentration of Se in serum (16{\%}) and milk (11{\%}) than cows fed YSe. Antioxidant status (whole blood and plasma glutathione peroxidase, and milk thioredoxin reductase and malondialdehyde) was not affected by treatments. Dry matter intake, yield of actual, energy-corrected, and fat-corrected milk, as well as milk fat and lactose concentrations, were not affected by the dietary treatments. Cows fed ISe had lower milk protein concentration (3.44{\%}) than cows fed YSe (3.58{\%}) or FSe (3.51{\%}). Cows fed Se-supplemented diets had a lower milk somatic cell count than cows fed the control diet. Results from the current study showed that the production of Se-enriched forages is an effective method to supplement dairy cows in Se as it was more available than YSe, and did not alter antioxidant status and performances of lactating dairy cows.},

Methods for locating these quantitative trait loci (QTL) relative to maps of genetic markers are now widely used. This paper addresses an issue common to all QTL mapping methods, that of determining an appropriate threshold value for declaring significant QTL effects. An empirical method is described, based on the concept of a permutation test, for estimating threshold values that are tailored to the experimental data at hand. The method is demonstrated using two real data sets derived from F(2) and recombinant inbred plant populations. An example using simulated data from a backcross design illustrates the effect of marker density on threshold values.},

abstract = {Milk urea nitrogen (MUN; mg of N/dL) has been shown to be related to excretion of urinary urea N (UUN; g of N/d) and total excretion of urinary N (UN; g of N/d) in dairy cows. In the present experiment, it was hypothesized that MUN and the relationship between MUN and UUN or UN is affected by urine volume as a result of dietary sodium chloride intake. Twelve lactating Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (mean ± SD: milk production 28.1±3.23kg/d and 190±41d in milk), of which 4 were fitted with catheters in the urine bladder and jugular vein, were randomly assigned to 4 dietary levels of sodium chloride (3, 9, 14, and 19g of Na/kg of DM) according to a triple 4×4 Latin square design. Cows were fed at 95{\%} of ad libitum intake, excluding salt addition. Milk was analyzed for MUN and protein content; urine was analyzed for total N, urea, and creatinine content; feces were analyzed for total N and DM content; and blood plasma was analyzed for urea and creatinine content. Creatinine clearance rate (CCR; L/min) and renal urea reabsorption ratio were estimated based on plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine, and total excretion of urea and creatinine in urine. Intake of DM and N, milk production, and milk protein content were (mean ± SD), on average, 21.4±1.24kg/d, 522±32.0g/d, 25.4±2.53kg/d, and 3.64±0.186{\%}, respectively. A linear relationship was found between Na intake and urine production [urine (kg/d; mean ± SE)=7.5±4.33+0.136±0.0143 × Na intake (g/d)] and between Na intake and MUN [MUN (mg/dL; mean ± SE)=13.5±0.35-0.0068±0.00104 × Na intake (g/d)]. Despite the decrease in MUN with increased Na intake, UN excretion increased linearly with Na intake. Excretion of UUN was not affected by dietary Na content. A linear plateau relationship was observed between CCR and renal urea reabsorption. An increase in CCR coincided with an increase in calculated renal urea reabsorption until a CCR breakpoint value (mean ± SD) of 1.56±0.063 L/min was reached. We conclude that Na intake is negatively related to MUN, whereas UUN is not affected. Variation in mineral intake levels that affect urine volume should, therefore, be taken into account when using MUN as an indicator of UUN in dairy cattle.},

abstract = {Partial least squares regression has been an alternative to ordinary least squares for handling multicollinearity in several areas of scientific research since the 1960s. It has recently gained much attention in the analysis of high dimensional genomic data. We show that known asymptotic consistency of the partial least squares estimator for a univariate response does not hold with the very large p and small n paradigm. We derive a similar result for a multivariate response regression with partial least squares. We then propose a sparse partial least squares formulation which aims simultaneously to achieve good predictive performance and variable selection by producing sparse linear combinations of the original predictors. We provide an efficient implementation of sparse partial least squares regression and compare it with well-known variable selection and dimension reduction approaches via simulation experiments. We illustrate the practical utility of sparse partial least squares regression in a joint analysis of gene expression and genomewide binding data.},

abstract = {A dynamic, mechanistic, compartmental model of phosphorus (P) digestion and metabolism was constructed in the Advanced Continuous Simulation Language using conservation of mass principles and mass action kinetics. Phosphorus was assumed to exist in 3 forms: inorganic (Pi), phytic acid (Pp), and organic (excluding phytic acid; Po). All 3 forms were assumed to be present in the digestive tract with absorption of Pi into blood. Inputs to the model were total P intake; Pp, Po, and Pi as proportions of total P; milk yield; rate of salivation (fixed at 239 L/d); and rate of liquid passage from the rumen (fixed at 198 L/d). The model was fitted to 2 experiments from the literature. Derived parameters were well defined by the data. With a mean observed P intake of 75 g/d, total tract P digestibility was 38{\%}. Phytic acid P digestibility in the rumen was 74{\%}, with no additional Pp digestion in the lower tract. Inorganic P and Po digestibility in the lower tract were 48 and 89{\%}, respectively. Flows of Po and Pi from the rumen were 2.4 and 3.0 times greater than intake, respectively. The increase in Po was apparently due to microbial growth. The increase in Pi arose primarily from secretion of Pi into the rumen via salivation where 65{\%} of absorbed P was recycled to the rumen. Milk synthesis used 30{\%} of absorbed Pi, and 1{\%} was excreted in urine. This research suggested that the primary regulation points for maintaining blood P were bone deposition and resorption and absorption from the intestine. However, because bone P balance was related to both dietary P intake and ruminal phytase activity, it is critical to achieve a better understanding of phytate digestibility across several feeds if dietary P is to be reduced below current requirements.},

abstract = {The problem of inferring haplotypes from genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is essential for the understanding of genetic variation within and among populations, with important applications to the genetic analysis of disease propensities and other complex traits. The problem can be formulated as a mixture model, where the mixture components correspond to the pool of haplotypes in the population. The size of this pool is unknown; indeed, knowing the size of the pool would correspond to knowing something significant about the genome and its history. Thus methods for fitting the genotype mixture must crucially address the problem of estimating a mixture with an unknown number of mixture components. In this paper we present a Bayesian approach to this problem based on a nonparametric prior known as the Dirichlet process. The model also incorporates a likelihood that captures statistical errors in the haplotype/genotype relationship trading off these errors against the size of the pool of haplotypes. We describe an algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo for posterior inference in our model. The overall result is a flexible Bayesian method, referred to as DP-Haplotyper, that is reminiscent of parsimony methods in its preference for small haplotype pools. We further generalize the model to treat pedigree relationships (e.g., trios) between the population's genotypes. We apply DP-Haplotyper to the analysis of both simulated and real genotype data, and compare to extant methods.},

Here we found that SARA goats exhibited significantly increased LPS concentrations in both the rumen and portal vein. The livers of these goats exhibited increased mRNA concentrations of pro-inflammatory genes that indicated inflammation. Meanwhile, the occurrence of liver inflammation was further validated by the enhanced protein expression of those cytokines in the livers of SARA goats. These increased expressions of detected pro-inflammatory genes were likely mediated by enforced TLR4 signaling because SARA increased the concentrations of TLR4 mRNA and protein in the liver and the abundance of both the NF-kB-p65 factor and its active phosphorylated variant. We also verified that the enhanced TLR4 expression was accompanied by chromatin decompaction and demethylation of the proximal TLR4 promoter. Hence, epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the enforced expression of immune genes during SARA, and these findings open innovative routes for interventions via the modulation of these epigenetic mechanisms.},

abstract = {The Bottom Line: What is the Correct Particle Size for Your Farm? The proper corn grain particle size for your dairy will depend on the following factors: 1. Type of forage fed. As corn silage increases, silage moisture increases, or as particle length decreases, the particle size of the corn grain should increase. 2. Forage particle length. You should have 8 percent to 10 percent of total mixed ration particles on the top box of the Penn State Particle Separator{\textregistered}. These particles are greater than 3/4 inch and ensure proper rumination and rumen mat formation. 3. Amount of dietary nonfiber carbohydrate (NFC). If the NFC content of the diet is over 40 percent of the dry matter, then particle size of corn grain needs to be increased. Any time the diet exceeds 40 percent NFC, the risk of acidosis will increase. 4. Method of feeding the grain. A total mixed ration will allow a much wider range of grain particle size to be fed. The bottom line is that there are no single particle size guidelines that will fit every situation; however, the guidelines in Tables I and II should help you get started. Be sure to monitor your herd's feed intake, manure consistency and grain appearance in the manure, MUN levels, milk production and composition. All of these herd indicators will tell you if you have the optimum corn particle size for your feeding situation.},

Diets contained 25{\%} alfalfa silage, 25{\%} corn silage, and 50{\%} concentrate, on a dry matter (DM) basis. Rolled high-moisture shelled corn was replaced with solvent-extracted soybean meal to increase CP from 13.5 to 15.0, 16.5, 17.9, and 19.4{\%} of DM. Each of the 4 experimental periods lasted 28 d, with 14 d for adaptation and 14 d for data collection. Spot sampling of ruminal digesta, blood, urine, and feces was conducted on d 21 of each period. Intake of DM was not affected by diet but milk fat content as well as ruminal acetate, NH3, and branched-chain volatile fatty acids, urinary allantoin, and blood and milk urea all increased linearly with increasing CP. Milk and protein yield showed trends for quadratic responses to dietary CP and were, respectively, 38.3 and 1.18 kg/d at 16.5{\%} CP. As a proportion of N intake, urinary N excretion increased from 23.8 to 36.2{\%}, whereas N secreted in milk decreased from 36.5 to 25.4{\%}, as dietary protein increased from 13.5 to 19.4{\%}. Under the conditions of this study, yield of milk and protein were not increased by feeding more than 16.5{\%} CP. The linear increase in urinary N excretion resulted from a sharp decline in N efficiency as dietary CP content increased.},

abstract = {The dairy industry continues to suffer severe economic losses due to the increased disease incidence cows experience during the transition period. It has long been the classical view that the major contributing factor to the development of these periparturient diseases is the considerable increase in nutritional demands for milk production. This classical view, however, fails to account for the substantial correlation between both metabolic and infectious diseases and the detrimental effects that can occur with the provision of high-energy diets to support these nutritional demands. Currently, increasing evidence implicates bacterial endotoxins in the etiopathology of most periparturient diseases. Bacterial endotoxins are components of the outer cell wall of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria that are highly immunostimulatory and can trigger proinflammatory immune responses. The ability of endotoxins to translocate from the mucosal tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, mammary gland, and uterus, into the systemic circulation has been observed. Once they have entered the circulation, endotoxins potentially contribute to disease either directly, through eliciting an inflammatory response, or indirectly through other factors such as the overreaction of the natural protective mechanisms of the host. Although the evidence implicating a role of endotoxins in the pathogenesis of transition diseases continues to grow, our current knowledge of the host response to mucosal endotoxin exposure and pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Developing our understanding of the connection between endotoxemia and dairy cattle disease holds significant potential for the future development of preventative measures that could benefit the productivity of the dairy industry as well as animal welfare.},

abstract = {The role of imprinting in body composition was investigated in an experimental cross between Chinese Meishan pigs and commercial Dutch pigs. A whole-genome scan revealed significant evidence for five quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting body composition, of which four were imprinted. Imprinting was tested with a statistical model that separated the expression of paternally and maternally inherited alleles. For back fat thickness, a paternally expressed QTL was found on Sus scrofa chromosome 2 (SSC2), and a Mendelian-expressed QTL was found on SSC7. In the same region of SSC7, a maternally expressed QTL affecting muscle depth was found. Chromosome 6 harbored a maternally expressed QTL on the short arm and a paternally expressed QTL on the long arm, both affecting intramuscular fat content. The individual QTL explained from 2{\%} up to 10{\%} of the phenotypic variance. The known homologies to human and mouse did not reveal positional candidate genes. This study demonstrates that testing for imprinting should become a standard procedure to unravel the genetic control of multifactorial traits.},

abstract = {The identification of genes that affect quantitative traits has been of great interest to geneticists for many decades, and many statistical methods have been developed to map quantitative trait loci (QTL). Most QTL mapping studies in experimental organisms use purely inbred lines, where the two homologous chromosomes in each individual are identical. As a result, many existing QTL mapping methods developed for experimental organisms are applicable only to genetic crosses between inbred lines. However, it may be difficult to obtain inbred lines for certain organisms, e.g., mosquitoes. Although statistical methods for QTL mapping in outbred populations, e.g., humans, can be applied for such crosses, these methods may not fully take advantage of the uniqueness of these crosses. For example, we can generally assume that the two grandparental lines are homozygous at the QTL of interest, but such information is not be utilized through methods developed for outbred populations. In addition, mating types and phases can be relatively easy to establish through the analysis of adjacent markers due to the large number of offspring that can be collected, substantially simplifying the computational need. In this article, motivated by a mosquito intercross experiment involving two selected lines that are not genetically homozygous across the genome, we develop statistical methods for QTL mapping for genetic crosses involving noninbred lines. In our procedure, we first infer parental mating types and use likelihood-based methods to infer phases in each parent on the basis of genotypes of offspring and one parent. A hidden Markov model is then employed to estimate the number of high-risk alleles at marker positions and putative QTL positions between markers in each offspring, and QTL mapping is finally conducted through the inferred QTL configuration across all offspring in all crosses. The performance of the proposed methods is assessed through simulation studies, and the usefulness of this method is demonstrated through its application to a mosquito data set.},

abstract = {The effect of contrasting concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates of herbage on silage fermentation and composition was examined using grass with high [250 g/kg of dry matter (DM)] concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates and grass and clover with low (66 g/kg of DM) concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates. Herbages were ensiled untreated, after inoculation with lactic acid bacteria, or after treatment with formic acid. Good quality silages were produced from herbage with high concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates, regardless of treatment, and all pH values were below 3.7 after 90 d of ensilage. However, the silage formed from inoculated herbage had a significantly lower concentration of ammonia N and a significantly higher proportion of residual ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase compared with the other two silages. Fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to measure ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, and measurement of true plant protein fractions in herbage and silage showed benefits over traditional measurements such as the measurement of N and ammonia N. Herbages with low concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates produced inferior quality silages that had lower ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase contents and higher ammonia N contents, regardless of treatment; few significant differences were observed among treatments. Under good ensiling conditions, when available water-soluble carbohydrate is adequate, the use of inoculants can improve fermentation characteristics and increase the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase content of silages. However, when the herbage has low concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates, even in inoculated herbages, lactic acid bacteria may follow a heterofermentative pathway instead of a homofermentative pathway, which can result in a decrease in silage quality and a reduction in intact ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase.},

abstract = {The objective of this descriptive study was to measure the amount of variability in the composition of 12 by-product feedstuffs commonly used in rations for lactating dairy cows in California. This study followed a prior descriptive study that was designed to provide the beginning of a nutrient database of by-product feedstuffs. Eleven of the by-product feedstuffs were from a single manufacturer source, with only soybean samples obtained from multiple sources. Samples of each by-product feedstuff were obtained from various locations in California and several locations outside the state. Variability in chemical composition and digestibility are discussed within each of the by-product feedstuff subgroups. Variation generally tended to be within acceptable ranges, although a wider variability was observed when sample numbers were smaller or the absolute value of the nutrient being measured was low},

abstract = {We constructed a regression model to estimate the retention of electronic boluses in goats. With this aim, 2,482 boluses were administered to goats from dairy (Murciano-Granadina, n=1,326; French Alpine, n=381) and meat (Blanca de Rasquera, n=532) breeds. A total of 19 bolus types made of materials (ceramic, plastic tubes filled with concrete or silicone, and ballasts) differing in their specific gravity (SG) were used, thereby obtaining a wide variation in bolus features: diameter (9 to 22 mm), length (37 to 84 mm), weight (5 to 111 g), volume (2.6 to 26 mL), and SG (1.0 to 5.5). Each bolus contained a half-duplex glass encapsulated transponder (32 × 3.8mm) and was administered using adapted balling guns. Murciano-Granadina and Blanca de Rasquera goats also wore 2 visual plastic ear tags: V1 (double flag, 5.1g) and V2 (flag-button, 4.2g). No data on ear tags in French Alpine goats was available. Bolus and ear tag retention [(retained/monitored) × 100] was recorded for at least 1 yr. Dynamic reading efficiency [(dynamic reading/static reading) × 100] was also evaluated from 1,496 bolus readings. No administration incidences or apparent negative behavior or performance effects were observed for any bolus type. Static reading efficiency of retained boluses was 100{\%}, except for the prototypes with metal ballasts, which yielded a 93.3{\%} reading efficiency. Retention of metal-ballasted boluses was confirmed using x-ray equipment. Excluding ballasted boluses, a 99.5{\%} dynamic reading efficiency was obtained. Ear tag losses were 6.5{\%} for V1 and 3.7{\%} for V2, ranging from 3.2 to 7.8{\%} depending on ear tag type and goat breed. Bolus retention varied (0 to 100{\%}) according to their physical features. Obtained data allowed the fitting of a logistic model of bolus retention rate according to bolus volume and weight (R(2) = 0.98); the SG was implicitly considered. Estimated weight and SG to produce medium- (15 mL) and standard-sized (22 mL) boluses for 99.95{\%} retention rate in goats were 73.0 and 94.1g, and 4.87 and 4.28, respectively. Mini-boluses are not recommended, as none of the available radio translucent materials reach the required SG. In conclusion, increase of SG was fundamental to optimize bolus retention. Medium-sized boluses (10 to 15 mL; SG 5.8 to 4.9) for early administration and efficient retention in adult goats could be produced, thereby addressing the problem of using proper boluses for goat identification.},

abstract = {Two corn varieties predicted to differ in digestibility were harvested at 2 cutting heights (10.2 or 30.5 cm) to determine effects on the nutrient content of the resulting silage, nutrient intake, nutrient digestibility, and production of lactating cows fed such corn silage originally harvested at two-thirds milk line. Acid detergent fiber (ADF) concentration was higher and in vitro true dry matter (DM) digestibility (IVTDMD) was lower for the variety predicted to have average digestibility. An interaction was observed between variety and cutting height because of decreased ADF and increased IVTDMD for the average digestibility variety cut at 30.5 vs. 10.2 cm; no differences were observed for the higher digestibility variety at each cutting height. When silages were fed to 32 Holstein cows in a 5-wk randomized design trial, DM intake, milk yield, and milk composition were similar. There was an interaction between variety and cutting height for DM intake and total tract apparent digestibility of DM, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber because of lower intake and digestibility for the diets containing either the high cut, average quality variety or low cut, higher quality variety. These results suggest that increasing the cutting height to 30.5 cm does not improve silage quality or improve milk yield of cows. Although the 2 varieties selected for this trial were predicted to differ in digestibility, these differences were not great enough to influence milk yield or composition of lactating cows.},

abstract = {Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplements containing a variety of isomers reduce milk fat yield. We have recently identified trans-10, cis-12 CLA as the isomer responsible for inhibiting milk fat synthesis in dairy cows. Our objectives were to determine milk fat yield and fatty acid composition responses to different doses of trans-10, cis-12 CLA. Multiparous Holstein cows (n = 4) were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Treatments consisted of a 5-d abomasal infusion of four doses of trans-10, cis-12 CLA, i.e., 0.0, 3.5, 7.0 and 14.0 g/d. Milk fat yield was decreased 25, 33, and 50{\%}, and milk fat concentration was reduced 24, 37 and 46{\%} when cows received 3.5, 7.0 and 14.0 g/d of trans-10, cis-12 CLA, respectively. Feed intake, milk yield, and milk protein content and yield were unaffected by treatment. Milk fatty acid composition revealed that de novo synthesized fatty acids (short and medium chain) were extensively reduced when cows received the two highest doses, but at the low dose (3.5 g/d), decreases in de novo synthesized fatty acids and preformed fatty acids were similar. Changes in milk fatty acid composition also demonstrated that (9)-desaturase activity was inhibited at the two high doses of trans-10, cis-12 CLA, but was unaffected by the low dose. Results indicate minimal quantities of trans-10, cis-12 CLA (0.016{\%} of dietary dry matter) markedly inhibited milk fat synthesis (25{\%} reduction) and that a curvilinear reduction in milk fat yield occurred with increasing quantities of trans-10, cis-12 CLA.},

Cows entered pens at calving and remained through 14 wk postpartum. Treatment assignment to pens was random throughout the barn. Pens were identical in layout and each contained an exit alley to eliminate feed and animal mixing. The 3 treatments were control: nonsupplemented; YC: control diet with YC (56g/d); and YC+EHY: control diet plus YC and EHY (28g/d). Mean pen dry matter intake was similar across treatments. Cows supplemented with YC and YC+EHY produced more milk, fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk than control cows (1.4 and 1.6, 1.6 and 1.8, 1.7 and 1.9kg, respectively). Treatments YC and YC+EHY did not differ. Milk fat and lactose percentages were not affected by treatment. Milk protein percentage was higher for cows supplemented with YC+EHY than for those on YC and control treatments (2.98, 2.93, and 2.91{\%}, respectively) with control and YC-supplemented cows not being different from each other. Differences in fat and protein yields were primarily reflective of milk yield. Treatment had no effect on milk urea nitrogen. No differences in the incidence of metabolic health were observed; however, cases of clinical mastitis for YC+EHY were less than half those for control and YC during wk 8 to 14 on trial. Somatic cell count was higher for cows fed control and YC diets compared with YC+EHY, primarily during wk 8 to 14 on trial. Supplementation of early lactation cows with YC improved milk production performance; furthermore, EHY supplementation improved milk protein percentage and mammary gland health.},

abstract = {Aerobic deterioration of silages is initiated by (facultative) aerobic micro-organisms, usually yeasts, that oxidize the preserving organic acids. In this study, a Lactobacillus buchneri strain isolated from maize silage was evaluated for its potential as a bacterial inoculant that enhances aerobic stability of silages. In four experiments, chopped whole crop maize (30–43{\%} dry matter (DM)) was inoculated with Lact. buchneri and ensiled in laboratory silos. Uninoculated silages served as controls. Analysis of silages treated with Lact. buchneri at levels of 103–106 cfu g−1 after about 3 months of anaerobic storage showed that acetic acid and 1-propanol contents increased with inoculum levels above 104 cfu g−1, whereas lactic acid decreased. Propionic acid, silage pH and DM loss increased with inoculum levels above 105 cfu g−1. Time course experiments with maize inoculated with Lact. buchneri at 4×104–2×105 cfu g−1 showed that up to 7–14 d after ensiling, Lact. buchneri had no effect on silage characteristics. Thereafter, the lactic acid content of the inoculated silages declined and, simultaneously, acetic acid and, to a lesser extent, propionic acid and 1-propanol, accumulated. Inoculation reduced survival of yeasts during the anaerobic storage phase and inhibited yeast growth when the silage was exposed to O2, resulting in a substantial improvement in aerobic stability. The results indicate that the use of Lact. buchneri as a silage inoculant can enhance aerobic stability by inhibition of yeasts. The ability of the organism to ferment lactic acid to acetic acid appears to be an important underlying principle of this effect. INTRODUCTION},

Traditional mapping approaches for analysing phenotypic data measured at a single time point are too simple to reveal the genetic control of developmental processes. A general statistical mapping framework, called functional mapping, has been proposed to characterize, in a single step, the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) or nucleotides (QTNs) that underlie a complex dynamic trait. Functional mapping estimates mathematical parameters that describe the developmental mechanisms of trait formation and expression for each QTL or QTN. The approach provides a useful quantitative and testable framework for assessing the interplay between gene actions or interactions and developmental changes.},

The silage was prepared from corn (Zea mays L), cultivar Buran FAO (240). The effect of the applied conservants on silage aerobic stability was also assessed. The performed chemical analyses comprised the determination of: the content of dry matter (DM), lactic acid (LA), acetic acid (AA), ethanol, water soluble sugars (WSC), crude protein (CP) and pH. The applied preparations were found to reduce the number of yeast and mould fungi cells in all the examined silages. The growth of fungi was inhibited most strongly by the FPA+i preparation (containing a mixture of formic and propionic acids and ammonium ions). The yeast cell counts dropped (P{\textless}{\textless}0.05) from 8.50 107 CFU g(-1) silage in the control (CCS = control corn silage) to 2.60 107 CFU g(-1) in silage treated with FPA+i, whereas counts of the mould fungi cells - from 15.20 104 CFU g(-1) silage in the control to 4.60 104 CFU g(-1) in silage treated with FPA+i. The applied conservants increased (P{\textless}{\textless}0.05) the content of DM from 255.00 g kg(-1) in control to 266.60 g kg(-1) with PA, WSC from 27.10 g kg(-1) DM to 30.50 g kg(-1) DM with FPA+i and ethanol from 9.10 g kg(-1) DM to 11.21 g kg(-1) DM with FPA+i in the silage. The additives decreased concentrations of lactic acid, acetic acid and crude protein concentration after opening the barrels. The diversifying factors decreased the pH value in the examined silage.

abstract = {Objectives were to investigate mechanisms by which a nutritional sup- plement alters immunity in dairy cattle. Our hypothesis was that feeding this product to dairy cattle altered neutrophil gene expression. Eight periparturient Jersey cattle were randomly assigned to one of two treat- ments: control and treated. Control animals were fed a dry cow ration for 1 month prior to calving. The treated cows were fed the same ration supplemented with OmniGen-AF. Following calving, blood samples were taken and neutrophils were prepared after which RNA was extracted. Gene expression in neutrophils of treated versus control-fed animals was then assessed using bovine-total leukocyte (BOTL-5) arrays. Eighteen genes were differentially regulated in the experimental group and of these, twice as many were up-regulated as down-regulated. Patterns of changes indicated that the additive might alter neutrophil apoptosis, signaling and sensitivity. Two of the regulated genes [inter- leukin-1b converting enzyme (ICE) and interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R)] were investigated in more detail using quantitative reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Each was found to be elevated by the feeding of experimental product. Increased expression of ICE indicates potential for enhanced neutrophil expression of interleukin-1b (IL-1b), a cytokine which plays roles in the inflammatory response and which stimulates adaptive immunity following innate immune activa- tion. Altered expression of IL-4R indicates potential for changes in neu- trophil apoptosis. The experiment identified mechanisms by which the additive altered neutrophil gene expression. While many nutrients sup- port the immune system, we have shown that a non-traditional nutri- tional approach may also have utility in modulating immune function.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate vaccine efficacy of a commercial vaccine (Startvac, Hipra Spain) aimed at reducing intramammary infections (IMI) with Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci under field conditions. During the 21-mo duration of the study, 1,156 lactations from 809 cows were enrolled in 2 herds. During the first phase of the trial, all cows that were due to calve were vaccinated until approximately 50{\%} of cows in the milking herd were vaccinated (at ∼6 mo). At that point, when 50{\%} vaccination coverage was reached, cows that were due to calve were randomly assigned to be vaccinated or left as negative controls. Cure rate, rate of new infection, prevalence, and duration of infections were analyzed. Vaccination resulted in a moderate reduction in incidence of new staphylococcal IMI and a more pronounced reduction in duration of IMI associated with reduction of the basic reproduction ratio of Staph. aureus by approximately 45{\%} and of coagulase-negative staphylococci by approximately 35{\%}. The utilization of vaccine in combination with other infection-control procedures, such as excellent milking procedures, treatment, segregation, and culling of known infected cattle, will result in an important reduction in incidence and duration of intramammary staphylococcal infections.},

abstract = {The objective of this analysis was to examine the intestinal digestibility of individual long-chain fatty acids (FA) in lactating dairy cows. Available data were collated from 15 publications containing 61 treatments, which reported total and individual FA duodenal flows and calculations of intestinal digestibility. All studies involved lactating dairy cows, and estimates of digestibility were based on measurements either between the duodenum and ileum (18 treatments) or between the duodenum and feces (43 treatments). Fatty acid digestibility was calculated for C16:0, C18:0, C18:1 (cis and trans isomers), C18:2, and C18:3. Digestibility of C18:0 was lower than for C18:1 and C18:3, with no difference in digestibility between saturated FA (C16:0 and C18:0). We weighted the studies by the reciprocal of the variance to generate best-fit equations to predict individual FA digestibility based on duodenal flow of FA and dietary independent variables. The flow of C18:0 negatively affected the digestibility of C18:0 and was also included in the best-fit equations for all other 18-carbon FA using duodenal flow characteristics. The type of fat supplemented had an effect on digestibility of individual FA, with whole seeds having reduced digestibility. Our meta-analysis results showed minimal differences in the digestibility of individual FA. However, C18:0 flow through the duodenum had a negative effect on the digestibility of several individual FA, with the largest negative effect on C18:0 digestibility. The mechanisms that reduce C18:0 absorption at high concentrations are unknown and warrant further investigation.},

abstract = {The objective of the study was to determine the effect of active dry Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ADSC) supplementation on dry matter intake, milk yield, milk components, ruminal pH, and microbial community during a dietary regimen that leads to subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). Sixteen multiparous, rumen-cannulated lactating Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments that included ADSC (Biomate; AB Vista, Marlborough, UK; 8 × 10(10) cfu/head per day) or control. During wk 1 to 6, all cows received a high-forage (HF) diet (77:23, forage:concentrate). Cows were then abruptly switched during wk 7 to a high-grain (HG) diet (49:51, forage:concentrate) and remained on the HG until the end of wk 10. Feed intake and milk yields were recorded daily. Ruminal pH was recorded continuously using an indwelling system for 1 to 2 d per week during the pre-experimental phase, and wk 6, 7, and 10. Ruminal digesta samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed for relative change in microbial communities using real-time quantitative PCR. Cows were considered to have SARA if the duration below pH 5.6 was ≥300 min/d. Ruminal pH during wk 6 (HF plateau) was not different across treatments (15 ± 46 min/d at pH {\textless}5.6). The dietary regimen successfully induced SARA during wk 7 (transition from HF to HG diet), and ruminal pH (551 ± 46 min/d at pH {\textless}5.6) was not different across treatments. However, cows receiving ADSC had an improved ruminal pH (122 ± 57 vs. 321 ± 53 min/d at pH {\textless}5.6) during wk 10 (HG plateau) compared with control. Additionally, cows receiving ADSC had a better dry matter intake (23.3 ± 0.66 vs. 21.6 ± 0.61 kg/d) and 4{\%} fat-corrected milk yield (29.6 ± 1.2 vs. 26.5 ± 1.2 kg/d) than control cows during the HG phase (wk 8 to 10). During HG feeding, cows receiving ADSC had greater total volatile fatty acid and propionate concentrations (175 ± 7.5 vs. 154 ± 7.5 and 117 ± 6.1 vs. 94 ± 5.7 mM for ADSC and control, respectively) and lower acetate:propionate ratio (0.26 ± 0.5 vs. 0.36 ± 0.05 for ADSC and control, respectively). Microbial analyses conducted on samples collected during wk 10 showed that cows supplemented with S. cerevisiae had a 9-fold, 2-fold, 6-fold, 1.3-fold, and 8-fold increase in S. cerevisiae, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Anaerovibrio lipolytica, Ruminococcus albus, and anaerobic fungi, respectively, which suggested an increase in cellulolytic microbes within the rumen. Cows supplemented with ADSC had 2.2-fold reduction in Prevotella albensis, which is a gram-negative bacterium predominant during SARA. Prevotella spp. are suggested to be an important source of lipopolysaccharide responsible for inflammation within the rumen. Cows supplemented with ADSC had a 2.3-fold increase in Streptococcus bovis and a 12-fold reduction in Megasphaera elsdenii. The reduction in M. elsdenii may reflect lower concentration of lactic acid within the rumen for ADSC cows. In conclusion, ADSC supplementation to dairy cows was demonstrated to alleviate the condition of SARA caused by abrupt dietary changes from HF to HG, and can potentially improve rumen function, as indicated by greater numbers of cellulolytic microorganisms within the rumen.},

abstract = {Four multiparous Holstein cows were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square experiment to study the effects of fat sources rich in omega-3 fatty acids on milk production and composition, follicular development, and prostaglandin secretion. All cows were fed a total mixed diet containing 60{\%} grass silage and 40{\%} concentrate. The four treatments were concentrates based either on Megalac, formaldehyde-treated whole linseed, a mixture (50:50, oil basis) of fish oil and formaldehyde-treated whole linseed, or no fat source in the concentrate but with 500 g per day of linseed oil being infused into the duodenum. Feed intakes and milk yield were similar among treatments. In general, the lowest digestibility was observed for the formaldehyde-treated whole linseed treatment. Feeding fish oil decreased milk fat and protein percentages. Alpha-linolenic acid increased from 1.0 to 13.9{\%} of milk fatty acids with linseed oil infusion. This confirms the high potential to incorporate alpha-linolenic acid into milk, and suggests that the formaldehyde treatment had little effect to limit biohydrogenation in the rumen. Increasing the supply of alpha-linolenic acid to these cows did not result in an increase in the concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid in milk. Levels of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2alpha in plasma were higher for cows receiving formaldehyde-treated linseed and fish oil. Increases in this metabolite in response to oxytocin challenge, tended to be lower for cows given linseed either as sole oil supplement in the diet or as a duodenal infusion of linseed oil. Follicle dynamics were similar among treatments. Larger corpora lutea (CL) were found with cows that received high levels of omega-3 fatty acids through the diet as formaldehyde-treated linseed or as a mixture of formaldehyde-treated linseed and fish oil, although CL were smaller when cows were infused with linseed oil into the duodenum. These results suggest that the improvement in gestation rate that was observed when feeding increased levels of alpha-linolenic acid in earlier work may partly result from lower levels of production of the dienoic prostaglandin PGF2alpha.},

abstract = {Our objective was to compare the effects of different prepartum dietary phosphorus concentrations on periparturient metabolism and performance. Forty-two late pregnant multiparous Holstein cows were fed 0.21, 0.31, or 0.44{\%} P (dry basis) for 4 wk before expected calving. After parturition, all cows were fed a common lactation diet (0.40{\%} P). In the prepartum period, cows fed 0.21{\%} P had lower blood serum P concentrations compared with cows fed 0.31 or 0.44{\%} P. However, serum P concentrations of all cows were within the normal range (4 to 8 mg/dL) until the day of calving when average concentrations dropped below 4 mg/dL. From 3 to 14 d postpartum, serum P of cows fed 0.21{\%} P was greater than that of cows fed 0.31 or 0.44{\%} P. No cows presented with or were treated for clinical hypophosphatemia in the periparturient period. Total serum Ca was lower before calving through 2 d postpartum for cows fed 0.44{\%} P compared with those fed 0.21 or 0.31{\%}. Prepartum dietary P treatments did not alter blood osteocalcin, hydroxyproline, and deoxypyridinoline, indicators of bone metabolism, or concentrations of parathyroid hormone or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Energy-corrected milk yield and milk composition (first 28 d of lactation) were not affected by prepartum dietary P concentrations. It is concluded that feeding 0.21{\%} P (34 g of P/cow daily) prepartum is adequate for periparturient multiparous Holstein cows with high metabolic demands and genetic potential for milk production. No adverse effects on periparturient health, dry matter intake, or 28-d lactation performance resulted.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Dairy Science Association. The objectives of the experiment were to evaluate the effects of feeding diets with distinct dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) levels and supplemented with 2 sources of vitamin D during the prepartum transition period on postpartum health and reproduction in dairy cows. The hypotheses were that feeding acidogenic diets prepartum would reduce the risk of hypocalcemia and other diseases, and the benefits of a negative DCAD treatment on health would be potentiated by supplementing calcidiol compared with cholecalciferol. Cows at 252 d of gestation were blocked by parity (28 nulliparous and 52 parous cows) and milk yield within parous cows, and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial, with 2 levels of DCAD, positive (+130 mEq/kg) or negative (-130 mEq/kg), and 2 sources of vitamin D, cholecalciferol or calcidiol, fed at 3 mg for each 11 kg of diet dry matter. The resulting treatment combinations were positive DCAD with cholecalciferol (PCH), positive DCAD with calcidiol (PCA), negative DCAD with cholecalciferol (NCH), and negative DCAD with calcidiol (NCA), which were fed from 252 d of gestation to calving. After calving, cows were fed the same lactation diet supplemented with cholecalciferol at 0.70 mg for every 20 kg of dry matter. Blood was sampled 7 d before parturition, and at 2 and 7 d postpartum to evaluate cell counts and measures of neutrophil function. Postpartum clinical and subclinical diseases and reproductive responses were evaluated. Feeding a diet with negative DCAD eliminated clinical hypocalcemia (23.1 vs. 0{\%}) and drastically reduced the incidence and daily risk of subclinical hypocalcemia, and these effects were observed in the first 48 to 72 h after calving. The diet with negative DCAD tended to improve the intensity of oxidative burst activity of neutrophils in all cows prepartum and increased the intensity of phagocytosis in parous cows prepartum and the proportion of neutrophils with killing activity in parous cows postpartum (58.5 vs. 67.6{\%}). Feeding calcidiol improved the proportion of neutrophils with oxidative burst activity (60.0 vs. 68.7{\%}), reduced the incidences of retained placenta (30.8 vs. 2.5{\%}) and metritis (46.2 vs. 23.1{\%}), and reduced the proportion of cows with multiple diseases in early lactation. Combining the negative DCAD diet with calcidiol reduced morbidity by at least 60{\%} compared with any of the other treatments. Cows with morbidity had lower blood ionized Ca and serum total Ca concentrations than healthy cows. Treatments did not affect the daily risk of hyperketonemia in the first 30 d of lactation. Despite the changes in cow health, manipulating the prepartum DCAD did not influence reproduction, but feeding calcidiol tended to increase the rate of pregnancy by 55{\%}, which reduced the median days open by 19. In conclusion, feeding prepartum cows with a diet containing a negative DCAD combined with 3 mg of calcidiol benefited health in early lactation.},

Replicated plots were sown between April and September in 2003 and 2004. Autumn management treatments were early and late cutting carried out in the establishment year and in subsequent years. Dry matter (DM) yields were measured over 3 years. One harvest was taken from April to July sowings in the establishment year and three harvests in each of the following years. DM yields from sowings in April and May were 2{\textperiodcentered}8 and 3{\textperiodcentered}3 t DM ha−1, respectively, in the establishment year, which were higher (P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}001) than from sowings in June and July.

abstract = {Thirty-nine commercial dairies in Merced County, California were enrolled in the present study to (1) compare lactating cow mineral intakes (via drinking water and total mixed ration) to the National Research Council (NRC) requirements, (2) evaluate the association between dietary concentrations of minerals with and without drinking water and adjusted for mineral concentrations in milk, and (3) compare 4 different methods to estimate excretion of minerals using either assays or estimations of milk mineral outputs and total daily mineral intake per cow with or without minerals coming from drinking water. Dairies were selected to represent a range of herd milk yields and a range of water mineral contents. Samples of total mixed ration, drinking water, and bulk tank milk were taken on 2 different days, 3 to 7 d apart in each farm. Across-farm medians and percentile distributions were used to analyze results. The herd median milk yield interquartile ranged (10th to 90th percentile) from less than 25 to more than 39 kg/d and the concentration of total solids in water interquartile ranged from less than 200 to more than 1,490 mg/L. Including drinking water minerals in the diets increased dietary concentrations by {\textless}4{\%} for all minerals except for Na and Cl, which increased by 9.3 and 6.5{\%}, respectively. Concentrations of P and K in milk were essentially the same as the NRC value to estimate lactation requirements. However, NRC milk values of Ca, Cl, and Zn were 10 to 20{\%} greater than dairy farm values; and Na, Cu, Fe, and Mn were no less than 36{\%} below NRC values. Estimated excretion of minerals via manure varied substantially across farms. Farms in the 10th percentile did have 2 to 3 times less estimated mineral excretions than those in the 90th percentile (depending on the mineral). Although including water minerals increased excretion of most minerals, the actual median effect of Ca, Mg, S, Cu, Fe, and Mn was less than 5{\%}, and about 8{\%} for Na and Cl. Replacing assayed concentrations of minerals in milk with NRC constants resulted in reduced estimated excretion of Ca, Na, Cu, Fe, and Zn, but median differences were {\textless}5{\%} except for Na which was 7.5{\%}. Results indicate that not including mineral intake via drinking water and not using assayed concentrations of milk minerals lead to errors in estimation manure excretion of minerals (e.g., Ca, Na, Cl, and S).},

abstract = {This study examined the chemical composition, in vitro and in vivo digestibility, aerobic stability and ensiling capability of the fresh wet fibrous by-products Aspergillus residue, soy pulp (okara), pomegranate pulp, grape pulp and avocado pulp. Ensiling was assessed in glass silos, and aerobic stability in open PVC containers. Intake and in vivo digestibility were measured in mature male Assaf lambs (four lambs/replicates per dietary treatment) held in individual metabolic cages, and ad libitum-fed one of the total mixed rations containing the examined fresh by-product and appropriate supplement. Aspergillus residue is an acidic, fibrous by-product, characterized by high in vivo digestibility of organic matter (OM, 0.85) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF, 0.95), and high stability under aerobic exposure. Ensiling results give large dry matter (DM) losses (41.2{\%}) and continuous yeast fermentation to ethanol and volatiles. Okara is an acidic, fibrous by-product that is rich in protein (290g/kg DM), characterized by high in vivo digestibility of OM and NDF (0.88 and 0.93, respectively), but low stability under aerobic exposure. It can be ensiled with moderate DM losses (16{\%}), producing butyrate and acetate. Pomegranate pulp contains high levels of soluble phenolics and sugars and its voluntary consumption by sheep is low. When fed to sheep it is characterized by low in vivo OM and NDF digestibility (0.44 and 0.20, respectively), and low aerobic stability. However, it can be ensiled with moderate DM losses (20{\%}). Grape is rich in ethanol and avocado pulps in fat content, and both byproducts are rich in lignin content and therefore have low in vivo OM digestibility (0.30 and 0.43, respectively) originating from their low NDF digestibility (0.12 and 0.31, respectively). These by-products are characterized by low stability under aerobic exposure. Both by-products can be ensiled without any DM losses or NDF solubilization.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate, retrospectively, which physiological states influenced the effect of vitamin E supplements during the dry period on the level of oxidative stress at 2 wk antepartum. Furthermore the effect of oxidative stress at 2 wk antepartum on the risk of clinical mastitis in early lactation was investigated. Cows experience oxidative stress around calving. Vitamin E is able to decrease oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals. Normally, vitamin E radicals formed when vitamin E reacts with free radicals are regenerated by a network of other antioxidants, termed the "vitamin E regeneration system" (VERS). In case of vitamin E supplementation, VERS should be sufficient to regenerate formed vitamin E radicals; if not, oxidative stress might increase instead of decrease. Additionally, the level of oxidative stress and vitamin E might be important physiological states to evaluate before supplementation. In a clinical trial, 296 cows on 5 farms were randomly divided into 2 groups, supplemented with a mineral mix between dry off and calving that supplied 3,000 or 135 IU/d, respectively. Blood samples collected at dry off and 2 wk antepartum were analyzed for vitamin E, reactive oxygen metabolites, ferric-reducing ability of plasma, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde. Cows were allocated retrospectively into 8 subgroups based on the level of oxidative stress, vitamin E, and VERS status at dry off. To evaluate whether differences in physiological states at dry off influenced the effect of vitamin E supplementation on the level of oxidative stress, group effects (supplemented vs. control) were studied with Student's t-test for all 8 subgroup at 2 wk antepartum. Differences in physiological states at dry off influenced the effect of vitamin E supplements. In 2 insufficient VERS subgroups, the supplemented group had higher levels of free radicals at 2 wk antepartum compared with the control group. Relative risk calculation was used to study the effect of oxidative stress at 2 wk antepartum on the incidence of mastitis in the first 100 d of lactation. Higher levels of oxidative stress at 2 wk antepartum were related to higher risk of clinical mastitis. In conclusion, not every dry cow responded well to high vitamin E supplementation. This subgroup analysis provides a possible explanation for the unexpected adverse effects observed in the clinical trial.},

abstract = {Although there is ample evidence with laboratory animals indicating that the Ca:P ratio in the diet is important, the evidence with ruminants does not consistently indicate detrimental effects from ratios devfiating widely from that thought to be optimum. It is commonly recommended that Ca:P ratios in the diets of l;aboratory animals be between 2:1 adn 1:2 although with adequate vitamin D, ratios outside these limits may be satisfacotry (maynard adn Loosli, '56). With dairy cattle, ratios up to 10:1 have produced no ill effects on milk production and calcium and phosphorus balance (Haag et al., '32; Lamb et al., '34). Using body weight gains of beef cattle as the criterion of response, Dowe et al. ('57) observed that a Ca:P ratio of 9.1:1 resulted in significantly lower gains than a ratio of 4.3:1. The inorganic phosphorus content of the plasma however, was not depressed below a level considered to be adequate. It was therefore concluded that excess calcium depressed gains by a detrimental effect upon nutrients other than phosphorus. Marston ('39) reviewed the early work and Duncan ('58) has reviewed and summarized more recent work on the role of calcium and phosphorus in ruminant nutrition. There is not complete agreement on the relative effect of amount and  of the ratio of calcium to phosphorus upon absorption and excretion of these two elements. Since much of the earlier work on this and related problems was done using gains in boy weight, balances and blood levels as measures of response, it seemed desireable to study directly the effect of various ratios of calcium to phosphorus upon absorption using the isotope dilution technique for measuring absorption. This paper reports the results of such studies.},

@article{Ibanez-Escriche2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the main limitations of many livestock breeding programs is that selection is in pure breeds housed in high-health environments but the aim is to improve crossbred performance under field conditions. Genomic selection (GS) using high-density genotyping could be used to address this. However in crossbred populations, 1) effects of SNPs may be breed specific, and 2) linkage disequilibrium may not be restricted to markers that are tightly linked to the QTL. In this study we apply GS to select for commercial crossbred performance and compare a model with breed-specific effects of SNP alleles (BSAM) to a model where SNP effects are assumed the same across breeds (ASGM). The impact of breed relatedness (generations since separation), size of the population used for training, and marker density were evaluated. Trait phenotype was controlled by 30 QTL and had a heritability of 0.30 for crossbred individuals. A Bayesian method (Bayes-B) was used to estimate the SNP effects in the crossbred training population and the accuracy of resulting GS breeding values for commercial crossbred performance was validated in the purebred population.

RESULTS: Results demonstrate that crossbred data can be used to evaluate purebreds for commercial crossbred performance. Accuracies based on crossbred data were generally not much lower than accuracies based on pure breed data and almost identical when the breeds crossed were closely related breeds. The accuracy of both models (ASGM and BSAM) increased with marker density and size of the training data. Accuracies of both models also tended to decrease with increasing distance between breeds. However the effect of marker density, training data size and distance between breeds differed between the two models. BSAM only performed better than AGSM when the number of markers was small (500), the number of records used for training was large (4000), and when breeds were distantly related or unrelated.

CONCLUSION: In conclusion, GS can be conducted in crossbred population and models that fit breed-specific effects of SNP alleles may not be necessary, especially with high marker density. This opens great opportunities for genetic improvement of purebreds for performance of their crossbred descendents in the field, without the need to track pedigrees through the system.},

It is unknown, however, whether the lower circulating $\alpha$-tocopherol concentrations precede LDA or remain after LDA. Using a nested case-control design, blood samples taken at d -21, -14, -7, -3, -1, 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 postpartum from 7 multiparous Holstein cows diagnosed with LDA between d 6 and 32 postpartum and 10 healthy Holstein cows from the same herd were analyzed for serum concentrations of $\alpha$-tocopherol and indicators of energy and nutrient status and inflammation. In addition to indicators of negative energy balance and inflammation, lower serum $\alpha$-tocopherol concentrations preceded LDA and persisted after LDA correction. At the last blood sampling before LDA diagnosis, cows had serum $\alpha$-tocopherol concentrations 45{\%} lower (5.0 ± 0.9 vs. 9.1 ± 0.9 $\mu$M) and $\alpha$-tocopherol to cholesterol molar ratios 39{\%} lower (1.90 ± 0.19 vs. 3.09 ± 0.26) than those of healthy cows. Serum $\alpha$-tocopherol concentrations remained lower ({\textless}10 vs. ∼15 $\mu$M) up to d 49 postpartum in cows that had LDA. These findings indicate that lower serum $\alpha$-tocopherol concentrations are a potential early indicator for the development of LDA in multiparous cows.},

After a calf consumed 2.50 kg of starter for 3 consecutive days, a small ruminant rumen pH data logger was inserted orally and rumen pH was measured continuously for 4d. Calves were then killed and rumen fluid was sampled to determine volatile fatty acid profile. No difference was found in overall average daily gain or growth rates of hip height, withers height, and heart girth. During the weaning transition, rate of increase in calf starter intake was greater for calves fed DDGS compared with those fed CRN (87.7 vs. 77.5 g/d), but lower for calves fed BP compared with CRN (68.1 vs. 77.5 g/d). The area under pH 5.8 (470 vs. 295 min × pH/d) or pH 5.2 (72.7 vs. 16.4 min × pH/d) was greater for calves fed DDGS than those fed CRN. Rumen pH profile was not affected by BP treatment compared with CRN, but calves fed BP tended to have greater water intake than those fed CRN (6.6 vs. 5.8 L/d). Volatile fatty acid profile was not affected by treatment with the exception of molar proportion of butyrate, which tended to be lower for calves fed BP compared with those fed CRN (15.0 vs. 16.6{\%}). Hay intake was positively correlated to mean rumen pH for calves used in this study (r=0.48). Decreasing dietary starch concentration did not mitigate rumen acidosis in calves during weaning transition, and low rumen pH did not adversely affect growth during the weaning transition.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the effect of substituting corn bran (CB) for dried ground corn grain (CG) in the nonforage portion of high-forage (HF) and low-forage (LF) diets. Twelve multiparous and 12 primiparous Holsteins were assigned to 4 diets using six 4× Latin squares with 3-wk periods. Forage was 64 or 38{\%} of the total mixed ration ({\%} of dry matter). On a dry matter basis, the HFCG diet had 20{\%} CG, the LFCG diet had 39{\%} CG, the HFCB diet had 19{\%} CB, and the LFCB diet had 38{\%} CB. Digestible organic matter intake (OMI) and milk energy yield were lower for CB compared with CG within forage level. Digestible OMI was greater (1.9kg/d) for the LFCG compared with the HFCG treatment. When CB replaced forage (LFCB vs. HFCB), digestible OMI was not different but milk energy yield was greater with the LFCB diet. The LFCG diet supported the greatest milk, milk protein, and milk energy yield. Decreased concentration of milk protein and increased concentration of milk urea nitrogen when feeding CB compared with CG suggests that lack of fermentable energy in the CB diets may have limited rumen microbial protein synthesis. Total substitution of CG with CB in the nonforage portion did not support maximum milk production, even when forage was reduced at the same time (HFCG vs. LFCB). Predicted neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility at 1 times maintenance, based on chemical analysis of the individual feeds, was 22 percentage units greater for CB than for the forage mix (68.9 vs. 46.9{\%}). In vitro NDF digestibility (30h) was 19.4 percentage units greater for CB than for the forage mix (68.9 vs. 49.5{\%}). However, in vivo NDF digestibility of the diet when CB replaced forage (HFCB vs. LFCB) was similar (44.1 vs. 44.5{\%}). Similarly, predicted total digestible nutrients at the production level of intake, based on chemical analysis, were greater for the CB treatments and lower for the CG treatments than those observed in vivo.},

abstract = {This study conducted according to a 4 x 4 Latin square with 28 d periods and four ruminally cannulated Finnish Ayrshire cows investigated the effect of protein supplements differing in amino acid (AA) profile and rumen undegradable protein content on postruminal AA supply and milk production. Mammary metabolism of plasma AA and other nutrients were also studied. The basal diet (Control; 13.4{\%} crude protein) consisted of grass silage and barley in a ratio of 55:45 on a dry matter basis. The other three isonitrogenous diets (17.0{\%} crude protein) were control + fishmeal (FM), control + soybean meal (SBM), and control + corn gluten meal (CGM). The protein supplements replaced portions of dry matter of the control diet maintaining the silage to barley ratio constant for all diets. Dry matter intake was limited to 95{\%} of the preexperimental ad libitum intake and was similar (mean 19.8 kg/d dry matter) across the diets. Protein supplements increased milk, lactose, and protein yields but did not affect yields of energy-corrected milk or milk fat. Milk protein yield response was numerically lowest for diet SBM. Protein supplements increased milk protein concentration but decreased milk fat and lactose concentrations. Microbial protein synthesis and rumen fermentation parameters were similar across the diets, except for an increased rumen ammonia concentration for diets supplemented with protein feeds. Protein supplements increased N intake, ruminal organic matter and N, and total tract organic matter, N, and neutral detergent fiber digestibilities. Protein supplements also increased N and AA flows into the omasum, with SBM giving the lowest and CGM the highest flows. This was associated with an unchanged microbial N flow and a higher undegraded dietary N flow. The omasal flows of individual AA reflected differences in total N flow and AA profile of the experimental diets. Differences in AA flows did not always reflect plasma AA concentrations. The results indicated that AA supply of dairy cows fed a grass silage-cereal diet can be manipulated using protein supplements differing in ruminal protein degradability and AA profile. Lower milk production response to SBM than that to FM and CGM appeared to be related mainly to lower N and AA supplies arising from a high ruminal protein degradability of SBM. Histidine appeared to be the first limiting AA for milk protein synthesis on the control diet. Mammary gland may regulate AA uptake according to requirements.},

abstract = {Previous work has indicated that dietary palmitic acid (C16:0) may increase milk fat yield. The effect of a dietary C16:0-enriched fat supplement on feed intake, yield of milk and milk components, and feed efficiency was evaluated in an experiment with a crossover arrangement of treatments with 25-d periods. A fermentable starch challenge on the last 4d of each period was utilized as a split-plot within period. Sixteen mid-lactation Holstein cows (249 ± 33 d in milk) were assigned randomly to treatment sequence. Treatments were either a C16:0-enriched ({\~{}}85{\%} C16:0) fat supplement (fatty acid treatment, FAT, 2{\%} dry matter) or a control diet (CON) containing no supplemental fat. Diets containing dry ground corn grain were fed from d 1 through 21 of each period. On the last 4d of each period, dry ground corn was replaced by high-moisture corn grain on an equivalent dry matter basis to provide a fermentable starch challenge. Response variables were averaged for d 18 to 21 (immediately before the fermentable starch challenge) and d 22 to 25 (during the fermentable starch challenge). We observed no treatment effects on milk yield or milk protein yield. The FAT treatment increased milk fat concentration from 3.88 to 4.16{\%} and fat yield from 1.23 to 1.32 kg/d compared with CON. The FAT treatment decreased dry matter intake by 1.4 kg/d and increased conversion of feed to milk (3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk yield/dry matter intake) by 8.6{\%} compared with CON. The increase in milk fat yield by FAT was entirely accounted for by a 27{\%} increase in 16-carbon fatty acid output into milk. Yields of de novo and preformed fatty acids were not affected by FAT relative to CON. The fermentable starch challenge did not affect milk fat concentration or yield. Results demonstrate the potential for a dietary C16:0-enriched fat supplement to improve milk fat concentration and yield as well as efficiency of conversion of feed to milk. Further studies are required to verify and extend these results and to determine whether responses are similar across different diets and levels of milk production.},

In experiment 1, a control diet (CON1) and diets supplemented with 56 mg of DADS/kg of dry matter (DM), 3g of YP/kg of DM, or 25 g of CAFU/kg of DM were evaluated. In experiment 2, an inert saturated fat source in the control diet (CON2) was exchanged isolipidically for an extruded linseed source (100g/kg of DM; UNSAT) or a mixture of C8:0 and C10:0 (MCFA; 20.3g/kg of DM). In experiment 2, a higher inclusion level of DADS (200mg/kg of DM) was also tested. Both experiments were conducted using 40 lactating Holstein-Friesian dairy cows. Cows were adapted to the diet for 12 d and were subsequently kept in respiration chambers for 5 d to evaluate methane production, diet digestibility, energy balance, and animal performance. Feed intake was restricted to avoid confounding effects of possible differences in ad libitum feed intake on methane production. Feed intake was, on average, 17.5 and 16.6 kg of DM/d in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. None of the additives reduced methane production in vivo. Methane production in experiment 1 was 450, 453, 446, and 423 g/d for CON1 and the diets supplemented with DADS, YP, and CAFU, respectively. In experiment 2, methane production was 371, 394, 388, and 386 g/d for CON2 and the diets supplemented with UNSAT, MCFA, and DADS, respectively. No effects of the additives on energy balance or neutral detergent fiber digestibility were observed. The addition of MCFA increased milk fat content (5.38{\%} vs. 4.82{\%} for control) and fat digestibility (78.5{\%} vs. 59.8{\%} for control), but did not affect milk yield or other milk components. The other products did not affect milk yield or composition. Results from these experiments emphasize the need to confirm methane reductions observed in vitro with in vivo data.},

abstract = {An investigation of the shape of the lactation curve and the mastitis incidence was conducted to identify whether management interventions of the lactation curve constitute a potential for reducing incidence of mastitis at herd level. Lactation curves were estimated to describe the variation of daily milk yield during the 305-d lactation period in Norwegian Red cows. Associations between mastitis incidence at herd level and lactation curve characteristics such as production level at onset of lactation, magnitude and time of peak milk yield, and increase and decrease of milk yield rates were studied. Data from 250,303 lactations occurring during 2005 and 2006 from 14,766 herds were obtained from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System. Besides veterinary treatments, the records included information on monthly test-day milk yields. The shapes of the lactation curves at herd level were parameterized using a modified Wilmink model in two separate mixed model analyses. In the first analysis a subset of lactations with no records of veterinary treatments was used. Lactation curves from herds with high ({\textgreater}0{\textperiodcentered}31 cases/305-d lactation) and low ({\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}07 cases/305-d lactation) herd mastitis incidence rate were parameterized and compared for three separate strata of parity. The result showed that high herd mastitis incidence rate was associated with a low intercept (P{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}05), a steep slope before peak milk yield (P{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}01) and a rapid decline after peak milk yield (P{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}01). In the second analysis a subset of high-yielding lactations with veterinary treatments of mastitis only and lactations with no records of veterinary treatment were compared. This was done to investigate whether the findings at herd level were also reflected at cow level. These results showed that lactation curves from lactations with mastitis cases were associated with a steep slope before peak milk yield (P{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}05) in second and later parities and a rapid decline after peak milk yield (P{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}01) in all three parity groups.},

abstract = {The use of forage legumes as a source of protein for ruminants is a sustainable strategy to reduce the use of inorganic-nitrogen fertiliser. In addition, some legumes species contain naturally bioactive secondary compounds, which could improve silage quality and digestive processes in ruminants. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of bioactive legumes containing condensed tannins or polyphenol oxidase, ensiled alone or in mixture with a grass, on silage quality and conservation characteristics. Six mini-silos were prepared in triplicate as follows: 100{\%} red clover (RC), 100{\%} sainfoin (SF), 100{\%} Timothy (T, control without bioactive compounds), binary mixtures 50{\%} T + 50{\%} RC, 50{\%} T + 50{\%} SF and ternary mixture 50{\%} T + 25{\%} RC + 25{\%} SF. Condensed tannins remain unaltered during the silage-making process in terms of quantity and chemical structures, while polyphenol oxidase is activated during this process. All the silages that contained bioactive legumes were better conserved than the pure grass silo. In addition bioactive legumes were able to preserve protein from their degradation during the silage process. Inclusion of bioactive legumes can improve silage quality, and polyphenol oxidase may be more efficient than condensed tannins to improve the nitrogen value of silage.},

abstract = {Efficient methods for processing genomic data were developed to increase reliability of estimated breeding values and to estimate thousands of marker effects simultaneously. Algorithms were derived and computer programs tested with simulated data for 2,967 bulls and 50,000 markers distributed randomly across 30 chromosomes. Estimation of genomic inbreeding coefficients required accurate estimates of allele frequencies in the base population. Linear model predictions of breeding values were computed by 3 equivalent methods: 1) iteration for individual allele effects followed by summation across loci to obtain estimated breeding values, 2) selection index including a genomic relationship matrix, and 3) mixed model equations including the inverse of genomic relationships. A blend of first- and second-order Jacobi iteration using 2 separate relaxation factors converged well for allele frequencies and effects. Reliability of predicted net merit for young bulls was 63{\%} compared with 32{\%} using the traditional relationship matrix. Nonlinear predictions were also computed using iteration on data and nonlinear regression on marker deviations; an additional (about 3{\%}) gain in reliability for young bulls increased average reliability to 66{\%}. Computing times increased linearly with number of genotypes. Estimation of allele frequencies required 2 processor days, and genomic predictions required {\textless}1 d per trait, and traits were processed in parallel. Information from genotyping was equivalent to about 20 daughters with phenotypic records. Actual gains may differ because the simulation did not account for linkage disequilibrium in the base population or selection in subsequent generations.},

abstract = {The effects of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (SCFP) on microbial fermentation in the digestive tract, milk production, and inflammation response were determined in Holstein dairy cows under normal and subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) conditions. Eight lactating dairy cows with ruminal and cecal cannulas were used in a cross-over design with 5 wk experimental periods. During the first experimental period, cows were randomly assigned to treatment, i.e. SCFP (Original XPC, Diamond V, Cedar Rapids, IA) or control. During the second experimental period, treatments were reversed. Experimental periods were separated by a two-week wash out period. During each period, the 4 cows on the SCFP treatment were supplemented with 14. g/d of SCFP in 126. g of ground corn, whereas the other four cows received 140. g ground corn only. During the first 4 wk of each experimental period, all cows received a basal diet. During week 5 of both experimental periods, a SARA challenge was conducted in all cows by replacing 208. g/kg of the basal diet with pellets of ground wheat and barley (50:50 on a weight basis). This SARA challenge increased the duration of rumen pH below 5.6 from 11.1 to 311.1. min/d, indicating successful induction of SARA. Inducing SARA reduced milk fat from 3.24 to 2.82{\%}, and lowered the acetate to propionate ratio from 3.07 to 1.74 in rumen fluid, from 5.13 to 4.57 in cecal digesta, and from 4.81 to 4.34 in feces. Induction of SARA increased milk protein content from 3.23 to 3.32{\%}, without a concomitant effect on milk protein yield. Inducing SARA also increased endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rumen fluid, cecal digesta and feces from 15,389 to 123,296 endotoxin units (EU)/mL, from 31,982 to 77,380. EU/mL, and from 29,679 to 77, 371. EU/mL, respectively. Concentrations of LPS, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, and LPS-binding protein increased by 215.0, 250.6, 181.6 and 47.5{\%}, respectively, in peripheral blood when SARA was induced. The SCFP did not affect feed intake, yields of milk, milk fat, and milk protein but it reduced the variation in rumen pH during control feeding. During the SARA challenge, SCFP tended to reduce ruminal LPS at 6. h after feed delivery, increased milk fat percentage (2.71 vs 2.92{\%}, control vs SCFP), and reduced the extent of SARA-associated inflammation response as indicated by a reduction in the concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (0.09 vs 0.03. ng/mL, control vs SCFP). This shows that SCFP can attenuate some of the impact of SARA on production and health of dairy cows.},

abstract = {Age at first insemination, days from calving to first insemination, number of services, first-service nonreturn rate to 56 d, days from first service to conception, calving ease, stillbirth, gestation length, and calf size of Canadian Holstein cows were jointly analyzed in a linear multiple-trait model. Traits covered a wide spectrum of aspects related to reproductive performance of dairy cows. Other frequently used fertility characteristics, like days open or calving intervals, could easily be derived from the analyzed traits. Data included 94,250 records in parities 1 to 6 on 53,158 cows from Ontario and Quebec, born in the years 1997 to 2002. Reproductive characteristics of heifers and cows were treated as different but genetically correlated traits that gave 16 total traits in the analysis. Repeated records for later parities were modeled with permanent environmental effects. Direct and maternal genetic effects were included in linear models for traits related to calving performance. Bayesian methods with Gibbs sampling were used to estimate covariance components of the model and respective genetic parameters. Estimates of heritabilities for fertility traits were low, from 3{\%} for nonreturn rate in heifers to 13{\%} for age at first service. Interval traits had higher heritabilities than binary or categorical traits. Service sire, sire of calf, and artificial insemination technician were important (relative to additive genetic) sources of variation for nonreturn rate and traits related to calving performance. Fertility traits in heifers and older cows were not the same genetically (genetic correlations in general were smaller than 0.9). Genetic correlations (both direct and maternal) among traits indicated that different traits measured different aspects of reproductive performance of a dairy cow. These traits could be used jointly in a fertility index to allow for selection for better fertility of dairy cattle.},

abstract = {Haplotypes have gained increasing attention in the mapping of complex-disease genes, because of the abundance of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the limited power of conventional single-locus analyses. It has been shown that haplotype-inference methods such as Clark's algorithm, the expectation-maximization algorithm, and a coalescence-based iterative-sampling algorithm are fairly effective and economical alternatives to molecular-haplotyping methods. To contend with some weaknesses of the existing algorithms, we propose a new Monte Carlo approach. In particular, we first partition the whole haplotype into smaller segments. Then, we use the Gibbs sampler both to construct the partial haplotypes of each segment and to assemble all the segments together. Our algorithm can accurately and rapidly infer haplotypes for a large number of linked SNPs. By using a wide variety of real and simulated data sets, we demonstrate the advantages of our Bayesian algorithm, and we show that it is robust to the violation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, to the presence of missing data, and to occurrences of recombination hotspots.},

abstract = {Five types of processed corn were compared to determine the effects of processing on lactational performance and nutrient digestibilities in dairy cows. Forty lactating Holstein cows averaging 160 +/- 60 d in milk were randomly divided into five groups on the basis of pretreatment milk yields and were fed diets containing 40{\%} corn grain for 56 d. Treatments were 1) finely ground corn, 2) coarsely ground corn, 3) steam-flaked corn at a low density, 4) steam-flaked corn at a medium density, and 5) steam-rolled corn. Cows fed the diet containing steam-flaked corn at a medium density had a higher milk yield (37.1 kg/d) than did cows fed the diets containing coarsely ground corn, steam-flaked corn at a low density, or steam-rolled corn; cows fed the diet containing finely ground corn had an intermediate milk yield (35.5 kg/d). Efficiency of feed utilization was greater, and dry matter intake was lower, for cows fed the diet containing finely ground corn than for cows fed the other diets. The fat content of milk was higher for cows fed the diets containing coarsely ground corn and steam-rolled corn than for cows fed the diet containing steam-flaked corn at a medium density. Milk protein and SNF contents and yields of protein, lactose, and SNF did not differ among diets. Apparent starch digestibilities in the total digestive tract were lower for diets containing coarsely ground corn (87.4{\%}) and steam-rolled corn (91.3{\%}) than for the other diets (X = 96.3{\%}). Milk yield was highest for cows fed the diet containing steam-flaked corn with a medium density. Fine grinding resulted in the greatest efficiency of feed utilization.},

abstract = {Effects of feeding a dry glycerin product (minimal 65{\%} of food grade glycerol, dry powder) to 39 multiparous Holstein dairy cows (19 control and 20 glycerin-supplemented; lactation number = 2.2 +/- 1.3 SD) on feed intake, milk yield and composition, and blood metabolic profiles were investigated. Dry glycerin was fed at 250 g/d as a top dressing (corresponding to 162.5 g of glycerol/d) to the common lactating total mixed ration from parturition to 21 d postpartum. Individual milk was sampled from 2 consecutive milkings weekly and analyzed for components. Blood was sampled from the coccygeal vein at 4, 7, 14, and 21 (+/-0.92, pooled SD) d in milk and analyzed for urea nitrogen, glucose, insulin, nonesterified fatty acids, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Urine was tested for the acetoacetate level weekly by using Ketostix. Average feed intake, milk yield and components, blood metabolites, and serum insulin concentrations were not affected by dry glycerin supplementation. Glycerin-supplemented cows experienced a more positive energy status (higher concentrations of plasma glucose, lower concentrations of plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, and lower concentrations of urine ketones), which was observed during the second week of lactation, suggesting that energy availability may have been improved. This glucogenic effect of dry glycerin did not result in an increase in feed intake or milk yield during the first 3 wk of lactation, likely because of the relatively less negative energy status of cows transitioning into lactation. The tendency toward higher milk yield for glycerin-supplemented cows during wk 6 of lactation (52 vs. 46 kg/d) after the supplementation period (dry glycerin was terminated at wk 3 of lactation) suggested a potential benefit of dry glycerin on subsequent milk production, perhaps through changes in metabolism, which requires further investigation.},

abstract = {The dairy industry in the United States has changed dramatically in the last decade. Milk production per cow has increased steadily because of a combination of improved management, better nutrition, and intense genetic selection. Dairy farms are larger, and nearly 30{\%} of the dairy cows in the United States are on farms with 500 or more cows. The shift toward more productive cows and larger herds is associated with a decrease in reproductive efficiency. Cows with the greatest milk production have the highest incidence of infertility, but epidemiological studies suggest that, in addition to milk production, other factors are probably decreasing reproductive efficiency in our dairy herds. The reproductive physiology of dairy cows has changed over the past 50 yr, and physiological adaptations to high milk production may explain part of the reproductive decline. Critical areas for new research include control of the estrous cycle, metabolic effects of lactation on reproduction, mechanisms linking disease to reproduction, and early embryonic mortality. Solving reproductive loss in dairy cows will not be easy because only a small number of research groups study reproduction in postpartum dairy cows. Therefore, the present research base will need to be expanded. For this to occur, research funding must be increased above its current level and a renewed emphasis must be placed on solving the emerging crisis of infertility in dairy cows.},

abstract = {The objectives of this experiment were to determine the effects of oral Ca supplementation on milk yield, body condition, pregnancy per artificial insemination (P/AI), and days to pregnancy in Holstein cows considered to be of low (LRM; no calving assistance, live singleton without retained placenta) or high (HRM; at least one of the following: dystocia, twins, stillbirth, retained placenta, or vulvo-vaginal laceration) risk of developing metritis. The hypotheses were that oral Ca supplementation during the early postpartum period would reduce the loss of body condition and improve lactation performance and reproduction. Four hundred fifty Holstein cows were blocked by parity as primiparous cows (n = 174) or multiparous cows (n = 276). Within parity, a cow considered at HRM was matched with a cow of LRM and the pair was randomly assigned to control (no Ca supplementation), 86 g of Ca on d 0 and 1 postpartum (CaS1), or 86 g of Ca on d 0 and 1 postpartum followed by 43 g/d on d 2 to 4 postpartum (CaS4). Body condition was scored at calving and 32 d postpartum and estrous cyclicity was evaluated at 38 and 52 d postpartum. Milk yield was recorded daily. Multiparous cows were classified as above or below the mean 305-d mature equivalent milk yield based on production in the previous lactation. Reproductive performance was evaluated for the first 210 d postpartum. Body condition did not differ among treatments, and cows lost on average 0.44 units of body condition in the first month of lactation. Calcium supplementation did not affect milk yield in the first 5 mo postpartum. For multiparous cows, Ca supplementation was beneficial to milk yield in the first 30 DIM in cows of greater production potential, but detrimental to multiparous cows with below average production potential. Calcium supplementation to primiparous cows reduced P/AI at first (control = 55.8, CaS1 = 31.5, CaS4 = 37.0{\%}) and all artificial inseminations (control = 48.5, CaS1 = 34.6, CaS4 = 38.5{\%}); however, Ca supplementation to multiparous cows improved P/AI at the first (control = 32.1, CaS1 = 38.6, CaS4 = 41.3{\%}) and all artificial inseminations (control = 28.1, CaS1 = 35.3, CaS4 = 40.5{\%}). These responses in P/AI to Ca supplementation resulted in extended median days to pregnancy (control = 75, CaS1 = 100, CaS4 = 94 d) and smaller proportion of pregnant cows (control = 89.3, CaS1 = 83.9, CaS4 = 83.9{\%}) in primiparous cows, but shorter days to pregnancy (control = 115, CaS1 = 94, CaS4 = 94 d) and increased proportion of pregnant cows in multiparous cows (control = 67.0, CaS1 = 77.2, CaS4 = 74.3{\%}). Risk of metritis depressed most measures of reproduction evaluated in the experiment. Results indicate that responses to oral Ca supplementation are conditional on parity and production potential of cows. Oral Ca supplementation was detrimental to reproduction in primiparous cows. On the other hand, Ca supplementation benefited reproduction in multiparous cows and milk yield in the cohort of multiparous cows of greater production potential.},

abstract = {A randomised clinical trial was conducted to explore the effect of orally supplemented medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) to heifers and cows starting 6-8 weeks prior to expected calving date on blood and milk polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leucocyte (PMNL) apoptosis between 1 and 3 d in milk (DIM). The effects of MCFA-supplementation on the likelihood of intramammary infections (IMI) in early lactation, and test-day somatic cell count (SCC) and average daily milk yield (MY) during the first 4 months of lactation were evaluated as well. Twenty-two animals were included of which half were orally supplemented with MCFA starting 6-8 weeks prior to calving and half served as non-supplemented controls. The PMNL viability in both blood and milk was quantified using dual-colour flow cytometry with fluorescein-labelled annexin and propidium iodide. In non-supplemented animals, {\%} blood PMNL apoptosis significantly increased between start of supplementation and early lactation, reflecting a potential reduction in innate immune capacity, whereas this was not true in the MCFA-supplemented animals. Similar results were seen in milk PMNL apoptosis. Overall, the {\%} apoptotic milk PMNL between 1 and 3 DIM was significantly lower in the MCFA-supplemented group compared with the non-supplemented group. There was no substantial effect of oral MCFA-supplementation on the likelihood of quarter IMI nor on the composite test-day milk SCC or average daily MY. In conclusion, oral MCFA-supplementation starting 6-8 weeks before expected calving date supported the blood and milk neutrophil viability in early lactating dairy cows. Still, this was not reflected in an improvement of udder health nor MY in early and later lactation. The results should trigger research to further unravel the mechanisms behind the observed immunomodulating effect, and the potential relevance for the cows' performances throughout lactation.},

abstract = {Reproductive failure in inseminated cattle results from poor fertilization and embryo survival. Recent studies utilizing dairy and beef cattle indicate that fertilization rates are higher for nulliparous dairy and beef heifers and nonlactating beef cows than lactating beef and dairy cows and nonlactating dairy cows. Several factors affect fertilization rates, but the greatest impact was observed for high producing cows under heat stress, when fertilization was only 55{\%}. Once fertilization has occurred, the fate of a successful pregnancy is then determined by the survival of the embryo and fetus. Losses of pregnancy are characterized by early embryonic death, which occurs prior to the period of corpus luteum (CL) maintenance in the cow at days 15-17 of the cycle, and late embryonic death, which occurs from CL maintenance to the end of the differentiation stage, at approximately 42 days of gestation. After 50 days of gestation, pregnancy losses are less frequent and characterize fetal death. Most pregnancy losses occur prior to the period of maintenance of the CL, but in high producing lactating dairy cattle, substantial losses continue to occur up to 42-56 days after insemination. Several factors affect pregnancy losses in cattle, such as compromised oocytes, which result in poorly developed embryos incapable of cross-talking with the endometrial epithelial cells, to inadequate uterine environment and infectious agents resulting in death of the embryo from undernourishment. Recently, studies have indicated that anovulation/anestrous, the metabolic status of the animal, some dietary ingredients, as well as occurrence of diseases, predispose the cow to experience embryonic and fetal death. Although some insemination protocols might impact embryo survival, when timed AI has been implemented properly, it has not influenced embryonic or fetal death in cattle. Improvements in reproductive programs in the future will have to focus on enhancing fertilization rates and minimizing embryonic losses to optimize conception rates in dairy and beef cattle.},

abstract = {Monozygotic (MZ) twins are partially concordant for most complex diseases, including autoimmune disorders. Whereas phenotypic concordance can be used to study heritability, discordance suggests the role of non-genetic factors. In autoimmune diseases, environmentally driven epigenetic changes are thought to contribute to their etiology. Here we report the first high-throughput and candidate sequence analyses of DNA methylation to investigate discordance for autoimmune disease in twins. We used a cohort of MZ twins discordant for three diseases whose clinical signs often overlap: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and dermatomyositis. Only MZ twins discordant for SLE featured widespread changes in the DNA methylation status of a significant number of genes. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment in categories associated with immune function. Individual analysis confirmed the existence of DNA methylation and expression changes in genes relevant to SLE pathogenesis. These changes occurred in parallel with a global decrease in the 5-methylcytosine content that was concomitantly accompanied with changes in DNA methylation and expression levels of ribosomal RNA genes, although no changes in repetitive sequences were found. Our findings not only identify potentially relevant DNA methylation markers for the clinical characterization of SLE patients but also support the notion that epigenetic changes may be critical in the clinical manifestations of autoimmune disease.},

The study design was a 2×2 factorial design with 10 cows per treatment. Treatments were WS total mixed ration (TMR) ad libitum, OG TMR ad libitum, WS TMR restricted, and OG TMR restricted. The WS TMR (dry matter basis) contained 30{\%} WS, 20.7{\%} corn silage, 10.0{\%} alfalfa hay, 18.2{\%} ground corn, 16.8{\%} soybean meal, and 4.3{\%} molasses mineral mix (14.7{\%} CP, 1.5Mcal/kg of net energy for lactation, 37.0{\%} neutral detergent fiber). The OG TMR contained 30{\%} OG, 46.2{\%} corn silage, 10.0{\%} alfalfa hay, 9.5{\%} soybean meal, and 4.3{\%} molasses (14.2{\%} CP, 1.5Mcal/kg of net energy for lactation, 41.0{\%} neutral detergent fiber). Cows received 1 lactation diet after calving (17.7{\%} CP, 1.6Mcal/kg of net energy for lactation, 27.3{\%} neutral detergent fiber). Total diet DMI prepartum was higher for ad libitum than for restricted as designed, but forage source had no effect on DMI. Total tract apparent digestibilities of DM and NDF were greater for OG than for WS. Postpartum DMI expressed as a percentage of body weight for the first week of lactation was higher for ad libitum than for restricted diets. Postpartum DMI during the first 30d of lactation was higher for OG than for WS, but no effect was observed for the amount fed prepartum. Milk yield during the first week of lactation was higher for OG than for WS; however, during the first 30d, 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk yield and yield of milk fat were highest for OG TMR restricted and WS TMR ad libitum. Prepartum treatments had a limited effect on pre- and postpartum lipid metabolism; however, cows fed WS TMR ad libitum had the highest postpartum $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate. Eating behavior was observed by 10-min video scans of 24-h video surveillance for 5d pre- and postpartum. Prepartum eating time and eating bouts tended to be greater by WS than for OG, and postpartum eating time per kilogram of neutral detergent fiber intake tended to be greater for WS than for OG. Results indicate that forage source and amount of DM fed prepartum affected postpartum performance and tended to alter the behavior of cows in tie-stall barns.},

abstract = {A recent study reported a 0.4 percentage unit increase in milk fat of lactating dairy cattle when dietary K was increased from 1.2 to 2{\%} with potassium carbonate. Because milk fat yield has been associated with ruminal production of certain conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers, 2 studies were conducted to determine if increasing potassium carbonate in the rumen would alter patterns of fermentation and biohydrogenation. In experiment 1, 5 dual-flow continuous fermenters were injected just before each feeding with a 10{\%} (wt/wt) stock potassium carbonate solution to provide the equivalent of 1.1 (K1), 2.2 (K2), and 3.3 (K3) {\%} of diet dry matter (DM) as added K. One of the remaining fermenters received no K (K0) and the last fermenter (NaOH) was injected with adequate NaOH stock solution (10{\%}, wt/wt) to match the pH observed for the K3 treatment. For experiment 2, 6 dual-flow continuous fermenters were used to evaluate 6 treatments arranged in a 2×3 factorial to examine 2 levels of soybean oil (0 and 3.64{\%} of diet DM) and added K at 0, 1.6, and 3.3{\%} of diet DM. In both experiments, fermenters were fed 55 to 57g of DM/d of a typical dairy diet consisting of 1:1 forage (10{\%} alfalfa hay and 90{\%} corn silage) to concentrate mix in 2 equal portions at 0800 and 1630h, and fed the respective diets for 10-d periods. Potassium carbonate addition increased pH in both experiments. Acetate:propionate ratio and pH in experiment 1 increased linearly for K0 to K3. Acetate:propionate ratio was lower for NaOH compared with K3 but the pH was the same. The trans-11 18:1 and cis-9,trans-11 CLA production rates (mg/d) increased linearly from K0 to K3, but K3 and NaOH did not differ. Production of trans-10 18:1 decreased and that of trans-10,cis-12 tended to decrease from K0 to K3, but production of trans-10,cis-12 CLA remained high for NaOH. Addition of K to the cultures in experiment 2 decreased propionate and increased acetate and acetate:propionate ratio for the 0{\%} fat diet but not for the 3.64{\%} fat diet. Addition of K increased stearic acid and cis-9,trans-11 CLA but decreased daily production of trans-10 C18:1 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA. The results indicate that increasing potassium carbonate in the diet shifts both fermentation and biohydrogenation pathways toward higher milk fat percentage in dairy cows, but the effects are only explained in part by elevation of pH.},

abstract = {Chromium (Cr) feeding in early lactation increased milk production in some studies, but responses to dietary Cr during peak lactation have not been evaluated. Furthermore, interactions of essential amino acids (AA) and Cr have not been explored. Our objective was to evaluate responses to CrPr (KemTRACE chromium propionate 0.04{\%}, Kemin Industries Inc., Des Moines, IA) and rumen-protected Lys (LysiPEARL, Kemin Industries Inc.) and Met (MetiPEARL, Kemin Industries Inc.) and their interaction in peak-lactation cows. Forty-eight individually fed Holstein cows (21 primiparous, 27 multiparous, 38±15d in milk) were stratified by calving date in 12 blocks and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments within block. Treatments were control, CrPr (8mg/d of Cr), RPLM (10g/d of Lys and 5g/d of Met, intestinally available), or CrPr plus RPLM. Treatments were premixed with ground corn and top-dressed at 200g/d for 35d. Diets consisted of corn silage, alfalfa hay, and concentrates, providing approximately 17{\%} crude protein, 31{\%} neutral detergent fiber, and 40{\%} nonfiber carbohydrates. Dry matter intake (DMI) significantly increased with the inclusion of CrPr (22.2 vs. 20.8±0.67kg/d), and energy-corrected milk (ECM) yield tended to increase. In addition, CrPr increased milk protein yield and tended to increase DMI in primiparous cows but not in multiparous cows. A CrPr×week interaction was detected for milk lactose content, which was increased by CrPr during wk 1 only (4.99 vs. 4.88±0.036{\%}). As a proportion of plasma AA, lysine increased and methionine tended to increase in response to RPLM, but the inclusion of RPLM decreased N efficiency (milk protein N:N intake). Digestible energy intake, gross energy digestibility, and energy balance were not affected by treatments. We observed no treatment effects on feed efficiency or changes in body weight or body condition score. In summary, feeding CrPr increased DMI and tended to increase ECM in cows fed for 5wk near peak lactation, with primiparous cows showing greater responses in DMI and milk protein yield than multiparous cows.},

Intake of dry matter was not affected by the addition of CIN or QCT, but cows fed YSE had lesser intake than cows fed the control diet (21.8 vs. 23.2 kg/d). Apparent total-tract digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber were unaffected by dietary treatments. Supplementation with CIN, QTE, or YSE did not affect in situ ruminal degradation of soybean meal, grass silage, or corn grain. Ruminal pH (6.67), total volatile fatty acid concentration (135 mM), and molar proportions (mol/100 mol of total volatile fatty acid) of acetate (65.0), propionate (19.6), and butyrate (11.2) were similar among treatments. Ruminal NH(3)-N concentration was not changed by the addition of CIN and YSE, but tended to decrease in cows fed QCT compared with cows fed the control diet (132 vs. 160 mg/L). Total numbers of ruminal protozoa were not changed by adding CIN, QCT, or YSE in the diet (5.85 log(10)/mL). However, the number of Isotricha was greater in ruminal fluid of cows fed CIN than in ruminal fluid of cows fed the control diet (4.46 vs. 4.23 log(10)/mL). Milk production (33.1 kg/d), milk fat (4.3{\%}), and milk protein (3.5{\%}) remained unchanged between dietary treatments. Results of this study show that under our experimental conditions, supplementing dairy cow diets with CIN, QCT, or YSE had limited effects on digestion, ruminal fermentation characteristics, and protozoal populations. The lack of effects observed in this study suggests that these antimicrobials require administration at greater doses to favorably alter rumen microbial fermentation.},

abstract = {A quantitative genetic model relates the genotypic
value of an individual to the alleles at the loci
that contribute to the variation in a population in
terms of additive, dominance, and epistatic
effects. This partition of genetic effects is
related to the partition of genetic variance. A
number of models have been proposed to describe this
relationship: some are based on the orthogonal
partition of genetic variance in an equilibrium
population. We compare a few representative models
and discuss their utility and potential problems for
analyzing quantitative trait loci (QTL) in a
segregating population. An orthogonal model implies
that estimates of the genetic effects are consistent
in a full or reduced model in an equilibrium
population and are directly related to the partition
of the genetic variance in the population. Linkage
disequilibrium does not affect the estimation of
genetic effects in a full model, but would in a
reduced model. Certainly linkage disequilibrium
would complicate the detection of QTL and
epistasis. Using different models does not influence
the detection of QTL and epistasis. However, it does
influence the estimation and interpretation of
genetic effects. },

abstract = {{\{}D{\}}airy producers use soyhulls, a byproduct of soybean processing,
to replace either grain or forage in diets of lactating dairy cows.
{\{}I{\}}n view of the nutritional and economical value of soyhulls it
is anticipated that this practice will continue to increase in popularity
among nutritionists and producers of ruminant animals. {\{}T{\}}his paper
reviews information regarding the nutritional value of soyhulls and
the effects of feeding this alternative feed on ruminal fermentation,
nutrient digestion and utilization, and performance of dairy cows.
{\{}S{\}}oyhulls can replace corn grain to supply about 30{\%} of the dry
matter ({\{}DM{\}}) in high-grain diets without negatively affecting either
the fermentation or digestion of nutrients in the gastrointestinal
tract or the performance of dairy cows. {\{}A{\}}dditionally, data suggest
that soyhulls might successfully replace forage to supply $\backslash$leq{\%}
of the {\{}DM{\}} in diets of dairy cows when the supply of effective fiber,
which includes a chemical and a physical component, remains adequate
after including the hulls. {\{}H{\}}owever, caution should be exercised
when data from different studies are extrapolated to practical situations
because the response to feeding soyhulls appears to be largely affected
by the type of carbohydrate being replaced by soyhulls; the amount,
type, and physical form of the dietary forage; and the incidence
of either negative or positive associative effects before and after
the addition of soyhulls to the original diet. {\{}U{\}}nfortunately, the
paucity of data from experiments in which soyhulls constituted more
than 25 to 30{\%} of the dietary {\{}DM{\}} restricts the ability to identify
the maximum amount of soyhulls that can be used in diets of dairy
cows. {\{}I{\}}nformation from studies in which $\backslash$meq 25 to 30{\%} of dietary
{\{}DM{\}} supplied as either cereal grains or forages are replaced with
soyhulls is needed to better understand and predict the production
of dairy cows fed diets containing the hulls. {\{}T{\}}his knowledge is
essential for maximizing the use of soyhulls in diets for dairy cows.},

abstract = {The effects of increasing concentrations of dried, pelleted beet pulp substituted for high-moisture corn on digestion and ruminal digestion kinetics were evaluated using eight ruminally and duodenally cannulated multiparous Holstein cows in a duplicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods. Cows were 79 +/- 17 (mean +/- SD) d in milk at the beginning of the experiment. Experimental diets with 40{\%} forage (corn silage and alfalfa silage) and 60{\%} concentrate contained 0, 6.1, 12.1, or 24.3{\%} beet pulp substituted for high-moisture corn on a dry matter basis. Diet concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and starch were 24.3 and 34.6{\%} (0{\%} beet pulp), 26.2 and 30.5{\%} (6{\%} beet pulp), 28.0 and 26.5{\%} (12{\%} beet pulp), and 31.6 and 18.4{\%} (24{\%} beet pulp), respectively. Ruminal dry matter pool decreased and NDF turnover rate increased as dietary beet pulp content increased. Potentially digestible NDF was digested more extensively and at a faster rate in the rumen with increasing beet pulp, resulting in increased total tract NDF digestibility. Passage rates of potentially digestible NDF and of indigestible NDF were not affected by treatment. True ruminal digestibility of starch decreased with increasing beet pulp substitution. This was caused by a linear increase in starch passage rate, possibly because of increasing ruminal fill, and a linear decrease in digestion rate of starch in the rumen, possibly because of reduced amylolytic enzyme activity for lower-starch diets. Although true ruminal starch digestibility decreased when more beet pulp was fed, whole tract starch digestibility was not affected because of compensatory digestion of starch in the intestines. Due to more thorough digestion of fiber in diets containing more beet pulp, whole-tract digestibility of organic matter increased linearly, and intake of digestible organic matter was not affected. Partially replacing high-moisture corn with beet pulp in low-forage diets increased fiber digestibility without reducing whole-tract starch digestibility.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Dairy Science Association This study aimed to evaluate the effect of replacing maize silage plus soybean meal with red clover silage (RCS) plus wheat on the fatty acid (FA) profile in the milk fat of cows. Forty-four lactating German Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods composed of 13 d of adaptation to diets followed by an 8-d sampling phase. Experimental diets offered as total mixed ration consisted of a constant forage-to-concentrate ratio (75:25) with target proportions of RCS to maize silage of 15:60 (RCS 15 ), 30:45 (RCS 30 ), 45:30 (RCS 45 ), and 60:15 (RCS 60 ) on a dry matter basis. Increasing the level of RCS in the diet was accompanied by a reduction of linoleic acid content in the diet and decreased linearly the proportions of linoleic acid in the milk up to 4{\%}. Proportions of $\alpha$-linolenic acid in milk increased 2-fold with RCS 60 compared with RCS 15 , which resulted from the linear increase in $\alpha$-linolenic acid intake with incremental levels of RCS. Vaccenic acid in the milk fat was reduced by 24{\%}. Rumenic acid, a conjugated linoleic acid (cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid) considered to be a human health promoter, was also decreased by 22{\%}. Reduced rumenic acid in the milk fat was probably due to a reduced amount of vaccenic acid produced in the rumen and, consequently, to the low amount of vaccenic acid to be desaturated to rumenic acid in the mammary gland by $\Delta$ 9 -desaturase. Oleic acid was enriched in the milk fat, although the dietary concentration of oleic acid decreased. Stearic acid proportions remained constant with increasing levels of RCS. The proportions of total polyunsaturated FA were increased by 12{\%}, and the long-chain FA proportions increased linearly with increasing levels of RCS. Myristic acid was reduced linearly, but palmitic acid remained constant. Saturated FA was reduced linearly by 2{\%}. Branched-chain FA, which are presumed to possess anticarcinogenic properties, were reduced to a small extent only (quadratic effect). We conclude that replacing maize silage with RCS appears to alter milk FA composition by reducing linoleic acid intake and ruminal biohydrogenation. Feeding RCS represents a strategy to increase intake of $\alpha$-linolenic acid in dairy cows. However, because changes in the FA profile show positive as well as negative effects, no distinct conclusions can be drawn with regard to human health benefits.},

abstract = {The callipyge mutation (CLPG) is an A to G transition that affects a muscle-specific long-range control element located in the middle of the 90-kb DLK1-GTL2 intergenic (IG) region. It causes ectopic expression of a 327-kb cluster of imprinted genes in skeletal muscle, resulting in the callipyge muscular hypertrophy and its non-Mendelian inheritance pattern known as polar overdominance. We herein demonstrate that the CLPG mutation alters the muscular epigenotype of the DLK1-GTL2 IG region in cis, including hypomethylation, acquisition of novel DNase-I hypersentivite sites, and, most strikingly, strongly enhanced bidirectional, long-range IG transcription. The callipyge phenotype thus emerges as a unique model to study the functional significance of IG transcription, which recently has proven to be a widespread, yet elusive, feature of the mammalian genome.},

abstract = {This experiment was designed to test the inclusion of highly fermentable sugars (FS) in dairy rations and their interactions with a slow-release urea (SU) product. The FS are a blend of liquid coproducts from the corn milling and cheese industries, and the SU is calcium chloride urea. Eight multiparous and 4 primiparous Brown Swiss cows (117 +/- 46 d in milk) were blocked by parity and utilized in a multiple Latin square design. Basal diets were formulated for 16.6{\%} crude protein and 1.55 Mcal/kg of net energy for lactation and contained 35{\%} of dietary dry matter as corn silage, 15{\%} alfalfa hay, 34{\%} of a concentrate mix containing varying proportions of ground shelled corn and soybean meal, and 16{\%} of a constant concentrate premix. The premix consisted of equal proportions of corn distillers grains, soybean hulls, expeller soybean meal, vitamins, and minerals across all diets. Diets contained either no supplemental FS (NFS) or FS (8.64{\%} RationMate) and either no SU (NSU) or SU (0.61{\%} Ruma Pro) in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Feeding FS tended to decrease milk production compared with feeding NFS. Milk fat percentage was increased for cows fed FS compared with NFS. Feeding SU decreased dry matter intake and increased feed efficiency compared with cows fed NSU. Dietary treatment had no effect on energy-corrected milk, milk fat yield, milk protein percentage, or milk urea N. Feeding FS increased the molar proportion of ruminal butyrate and decreased the molar proportion of propionate; however, no other effects were observed on ruminal fermentation. No interactions between FS and SU were observed. It was concluded that the replacement of corn and soybean meal with dietary FS increased milk fat percentage and that the replacement of soybean meal with SU significantly improved feed efficiency.},

abstract = {The main objective of this study was to evaluate correlative relationships between rumen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mediators of acute phase response with milk fat yield and efficiency in dairy cows challenged with graded amounts of barley grain in the diet. An additional aim of the study was to quantify the intercow variation in relation to milk fat production and acute phase response in cows fed graded amounts of grain. Eight primiparous, lactating Holstein cows (60 d in milk) were assigned to 1 of the 4 total mixed rations containing barley grain at 0, 15, 30, and 45{\%} (dry matter basis) in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design. Free rumen LPS, plasma acute phase proteins, and milk fat content were quantified in multiple samples collected on d 5 and 7 of the measurement periods shortly before the morning feeding. Results showed markedly greater concentrations of rumen LPS with increasing dietary grain level. The correlative analysis revealed strong negative relationships between rumen LPS and milk fat content and yield. The predictor variable of rumen LPS explained 69{\%} of the variation during the milk fat reduction of the cows. The stronger depression in milk fat percentage was obtained when rumen LPS exceeded a threshold of 5,564 ng/mL, corresponding to a milk fat content of 3.39{\%}. The increase in concentration of rumen LPS was also associated with declines in milk fat yield and 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk (R(2) = 0.50), as well as milk energy efficiency (R(2) = 0.43). The correlative analysis also indicated that the increase of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) in response to higher grain feeding was associated with a linear decrease of milk fat content and yield (R(2) = 0.28 to 0.46). Furthermore, the statistical analysis revealed high percentages of intercow variation related to milk fat variables, as well as the responses of rumen LPS and plasma CRP. Taken together, the current results implicate rumen LPS and the host CRP response in the lowering of milk fat content and milk energy efficiency in dairy cows fed high-grain diets. Further research is warranted to understand the mechanism(s) by which rumen LPS and inflammatory responses to LPS lower milk fat synthesis and milk energy efficiency and to develop novel strategies for their prevention.},

abstract = {A QTL located in the paternally expressed insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene is known to increase muscle growth and reduce fat deposition in pigs. This makes the QTL in IGF2 a good marker for use in pig breeding programmes. However, care has to be taken as it is postulated that increased leanness and lowered fat deposition may have a negative effect on the prolificacy and longevity of sows. Selection of sire and dam lines for different alleles of the mutation in the paternally imprinted IGF2 gene could actually provide a solution to this problem. Therefore, in this study, the effect of the IGF2 QTL on prolificacy-related traits in sows was investigated. It was found that the paternal IGF2 wild-type allele was associated with higher reproduction performance in the sow. Moreover, it was also examined whether the difference in prolificacy in sows could be a consequence of differential IGF2 expression in the ovarian follicles of the sow or whether it is mainly a secondary effect caused by differences in fatness traits. Therefore, IGF2 expression was measured in follicles of different sizes from sows with different genotypes for the paternal IGF2 allele. It was observed that, however, while the size of the follicles was associated with follicular IGF2 expression level, the IGF2 genotype was not. It could be concluded that the difference in prolificacy of sows with a different paternal IGF2 genotype could be a secondary effect, resulting from differences in fat deposition.},

Three leafy corn silage hybrids were harvested at NC and HC at about 34{\%} dry matter (E) and 41{\%} DM (L) and ensiled in laboratory silos. Increasing the height of cutting lowered yields of harvested DM/ha. In addition, the concentrations of DM and starch were higher but the concentrations of lactic acid, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber were lower in HC than in NC. The concentration of acid detergent lignin was also lower in HC, but only in corn harvested at E. In vitro digestion (30 h) of NDF was greater in HC (50.7{\%}) than NC (48.3{\%}). Calculated yield of milk per tonne of forage DM was greater for HC than for NC at E but not at L. In a lactation experiment, increasing the height of cutting of another leafy corn silage hybrid, TMF29400, in general also resulted in similar changes in nutrient composition as just described. When fed to lactating dairy cows, HC corn silage resulted in tendencies for greater NDF digestion in the total tract, higher milk production and improved feed efficiency, but there were no differences in 3.5{\%} fat corrected milk between treatments. Results of this study suggest that increasing the cutting height of whole plant corn at harvest can improve the nutritive value of corn silage for lactating dairy cows.},

Two measures of cellulose crystallinity calculated from the X-ray diffraction pattern indicated that treatment of barley straw with 30 g NH3 kg-1 straw produced a reduction in crystallinity index values of 14-24{\%}.  The water retention of ammonia-treated barley straw was approximate 25{\%} greater than that of the untreated straw following centrifugation at 300 g and 3000 g.  A slightly higher swollen volume was also observed for water-saturated ammonia-treated barley straw, although the difference was not significant.  It is suggested that two major consequences of treatment, the effect of ammonia as a weak base on ester bonding within the cell wall and the ability of ammonia in an undissociated form to affect cellulose crystallinity, combine to increase the degradability of the untreated straw.},

Individual pen designs should have two solid sides, but the front and rear should be as open as possible. Thermal stress should be managed by providing deep bedding and not by enclosing the pen. Air hygiene can be improved by reducing stocking density and using supplemental positive-pressure ventilation systems to deliver small amounts of air to each pen. Implementation of these recommendations can produce calf barns that seem to equal calf hutches in minimizing disease and provide better working conditions for the caregivers. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Holstein (n = 116) and Jersey (n = 46) bull (n = 74) and heifer (n = 88) calves were assigned randomly within sex at birth to treatments. All calves were fed 3.8 L of colostrum daily for the first 2 d. Holstein calves were fed 3.8 L of whole milk, and Jersey calves were fed 2.8 L of whole milk through weaning at 42 d. Calves continued on trial through 63 d. Six treatments were arranged as a 2 x 3 factorial. Calves received either a corn-soybean meal-based starter (21{\%} crude protein and 6{\%} acid detergent fiber; -CSH) or a blend of 85{\%} corn-soybean meal-based starter and 15{\%} CSH (18{\%} crude protein and 14{\%} acid detergent fiber; +CSH) ad libitum. In addition, calves received whole milk with either no supplement (NONE) or supplemented with 3 g/d of mannanoligosaccharide product (MOS) or 4 g/d of live yeast product (YST) through weaning at 42 d. Twelve Holstein steers [n = 6 (per starter type); n = 4 (per supplement type)] were euthanized for collection and examination of rumen tissue samples. Dry matter intake (DMI) was greater for Holstein calves fed +CSH (0.90 kg/d) than -CSH (0.76 kg/d). Final body weight at 63 d of Holstein calves fed +CSH (75.8 kg) was greater than that of those fed -CSH (71.0 kg). Average daily gain (ADG) was greater for Holstein calves fed +CSH (0.58 kg/d) than -CSH (0.52 kg/d). However, Holstein calves fed -CSH had a greater feed efficiency (FE; 0.71 kg of ADG/kg of DMI) than those fed +CSH (0.65 kg of ADG/kg of DMI). Also, Holstein calves fed +CSH had narrower rumen papillae (0.32 mm) compared with those fed -CSH (0.41 mm). There were no significant effects of CSH on DMI, ADG, or FE in Jersey calves. There were no significant effects of YST or MOS on DMI, ADG, FE, or rumen papillae measures in Holstein calves. Jersey calves fed YST or MOS had greater final body weight at 63 d (51.2 kg and 51.0 kg, respectively) than calves fed NONE (47.5 kg). However, there were no significant effects of YST or MOS on DMI, ADG, or FE in Jersey calves.},

abstract = {The relative proportion of additive and non-additive variation for complex traits is important in evolutionary biology, medicine, and agriculture. We address a long-standing controversy and paradox about the contribution of non-additive genetic variation, namely that knowledge about biological pathways and gene networks imply that epistasis is important. Yet empirical data across a range of traits and species imply that most genetic variance is additive. We evaluate the evidence from empirical studies of genetic variance components and find that additive variance typically accounts for over half, and often close to 100{\%}, of the total genetic variance. We present new theoretical results, based upon the distribution of allele frequencies under neutral and other population genetic models, that show why this is the case even if there are non-additive effects at the level of gene action. We conclude that interactions at the level of genes are not likely to generate much interaction at the level of variance.},

abstract = {The effects of treating cereal straws with NaOH and ammonia on methane production by sheep are reported. One oat, two wheat and two barley straws were either untreated or treated with NaOH (45 kg t-1 dry matter (DM)) and ammonia (35 kg t-1 DM). The straws were supplemented with urea and sodium sulphate as appropriate to provide a dietary N S ratio of 14.4 : 1 and given ad libitum to mature wether sheep. Methane production was measured in open circuit respiration chambers following a 20 day period on each diet. The digestibility of various feed fractions was measured both in vitro and in vivo. Methane production as a proportion of gross energy intake (range 0.047-0.067) was not significantly affected by treatment, although the volume of methane produced per animal was significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) increased (Control, 17.8; NH3, 26.2; NaOH 30.1 1 per animal per day). However, when methane production was expressed relative to intake of digestible organic matter, treatment significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) reduced production (Control, 55.0; NH3, 43.7; NaOH, 48.1 1 kg-1 organic matter apparently digested). The significance of these findings in relation to reducing methane emissions to the atmosphere is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {The objective was to compare pregnancy per AI (P/AI) with conventional (CON) or sex-sorted (SS) semen from a single sire within a fixed-time AI (FTAI) program designed for dairy heifers. Holstein heifers (n=240) were assigned to treatment (CON or SS) according to body weight and reproductive tract score. All heifers underwent FTAI by using the "Show-Me-Synch" protocol [controlled internal drug release (CIDR) insert from d 0 to 14 followed by PGF(2$\alpha$) (25mg i.m.) 16d after insert removal (d 30) with GnRH (100 µg i.m.) and FTAI at 66 h after PGF(2$\alpha$)]. A single professional technician performed the FTAI. Heifers were fitted with heat detection patches at PGF(2$\alpha$) to characterize estrous response. Estrous response did not differ between CON (63/120; 53{\%}) and SS (70/120; 58{\%}) treatments. The CON heifers, however, achieved greater FTAI P/AI (82/120; 68{\%}) compared with SS (45/120; 38{\%}) heifers. The P/AI did not differ for CON heifers that exhibited or failed to exhibit estrus before FTAI [44/63 (70{\%}) vs. 38/57(67{\%}), respectively]. For SS heifers, however, those that exhibited estrus had greater P/AI compared with those that failed to exhibit estrus [32/70 (46{\%}) vs. 13/50 (26{\%})]. Pregnancy per AI resulting from FTAI was greater for heifers that were inseminated with CON semen compared with those that received SS semen. The expression of estrus before FTAI did not affect P/AI when CON semen was used, whereas the P/AI with SS semen was greater for heifers detected in estrus. Further studies are required to develop strategies for using sex-sorted semen when inseminating heifers at predetermined fixed times on the basis of expression of estrus before FTAI.},

abstract = {This analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of palmitic acid-enriched supplements (PA; {\textgreater} 80{\%} C16:0) on production response, nutrient digestibility, and energy partitioning of post-peak dairy cows. The database was formed with 1,056 individual observations from 215 dairy cows in 12 studies. Diet mean nutrient content ({\%} DM) was 30{\%} NDF (range 24 to 37{\%}), 17{\%} CP (range 16.7 to 17.8{\%}), 27{\%} starch (range 22 to 32{\%}), and 3.95{\%} fatty acids (FA; range 2.1 to 5.6{\%}). PA was fed on average at 1.8{\%} of diet DM (range from 0.75 to 2.25{\%}) replacing either soyhulls or ground corn in diets. The effects of PA were compared to non-fat supplemented diets used as controls (CON). The meta-analysis was performed to calculate the mean difference in least square means between CON and PA treatments using a model considering the ran - dom effects of study and cow. The meta-regression evaluated the effect of C16:0 intake using a random regression model. PA compared with CON did not affect DMI ( P = 0.32), milk yield ( P = 0.37), BW ( P = 0.70), or BCS ( P = 0.75), but in - creased milk fat content (3.81 vs. 3.58{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01), milk fat yield (1.59 vs. 1.49 kg/d; P {\textless} 0.01), 3.5{\%} FCM (44.8 vs. 43.0 kg/d; P  ), and feed efficiency ( FCMDMI  vs. 1.53; P {\textless} 0.01). PA increased 16-carbon milk FA yield (590 vs. 475 g/d; P {\textless} 0.01) compared with CON but did not affect de novo ( P = 0.23) or preformed ( P = 0.76) milk FA yields. PA increased NDF digestibility (44.3 vs. 41.5{\%}; P = 0.02), 18-carbon FA digestibility (80.3 vs. 78.4{\%}; P = 0.02) and DM digestibility (68.2 vs. 66.7{\%}; P = 0.01), but reduced 16-carbon FA digestibility (68.4 vs. 74.3{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01), and to - tal FA digestibility (71.5 vs. 75.8{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01) compared with CON. PA increased net energy intake (47.4 vs. 46.0 Mcal/d; P = 0.04), milk energy output (31.1 vs. 29.9 Mcal/d; P = 0.01) and partitioned more dietary energy to milk (66.6 vs. 65.0{\%}, P = 0.03) compared with CON. Using the random regression model we observed positive linear relationships between C16:0 intake and milk fat yield ( P {\textless} 0.01; R 2 = 0.57), 3.5{\%} FCM ( P {\textless} 0.01; R 2 = 0.53), and 16-carbon milk FA ( P {\textless} 0.01; R 2 = 0.87), as well as NDF digestibility ( P = 0.01; R 2 = 0.55) and energy partitioned toward milk ( P = 0.01; R 2 = 0.47), but a negative linear relationship for total FA digestibility ( P = 0.01; R 2 = 0.64). In conclusion, supplementation of palmitic acid-enriched supplements increased yields of milk fat and  FCM, feed efficiency, and NDF digestibility with no re - duction in DMI or loss of BW or BCS.},

Preservatives are more effective at low pH values where solutions contain increased concentrations of undissociated acids. Inhibition by weak-acids involves rapid diffusion of undissociated molecules through the plasma membrane; dissociation of these molecules within cells liberates protons, thus acidifying the cytoplasm and preventing growth. By modelling preservative action in yeast, using a thermodynamic and kinetic approach, it was possible to demonstrate that: (i) inhibition depends more on the degree to which individual preservatives are concentrated within cells, rather than on undissociated acid concentration per se; (ii) it is entirely feasible for microbes to pump protons out of the cell during extended lag phase and raise internal pH (pHi), despite further influx of preservatives; (iii) the duration of the lag phase can be predicted from the model, using a Gaussian fit of proton-pumping H(+)-ATPase activity against pHi; (iv) theoretical ATP consumption for proton pumping can be directly correlated with the reduction in cell yield observed in glucose-limited cultures.},

Recent years have witnessed a significant scientific interest on vitamin D and expanded its actions to include immune modulation, cell differentiation and proliferation and inflammation regulation. As our understanding of the many functions of vitamin D has grown, the presence of vitamin D deficiency has become one of the most prevalent micronutrient deficiencies worldwide. Concomitantly, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common form of chronic liver disease in western countries. NAFLD and vitamin D deficiency often coexist and epidemiologic evidence has shown that both of these conditions share several cardiometabolic risk factors. In this article we provide an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology linking NAFLD and vitamin D deficiency, as well as the available evidence on the clinical utility of vitamin D supplementation in NAFLD.},

Cows were 79 +/- 17 (mean +/- SD) d in milk at the beginning of the experiment. Experimental diets with 40{\%} forage (corn silage and alfalfa silage) and 60{\%} concentrate contained 0, 6.1, 12.1, or 24.3{\%} beet pulp substituted for high-moisture corn on a dry matter basis. Diet concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and starch were 24.3 and 34.6{\%} (0{\%} beet pulp), 26.2 and 30.5{\%} (6{\%} beet pulp), 28.0 and 26.5{\%} (12{\%} beet pulp), and 31.6 and 18.4{\%} (24{\%} beet pulp), respectively. Increasing beet pulp in the diet caused a linear decrease in dry matter intake (DMI). Time spent eating per day and per kilogram of DMI increased, and sorting against NDF tended to increase, with added beet pulp. Substituting beet pulp for corn caused a quadratic response in milk fat yield, with the highest yield for the 6{\%} beet pulp treatment. A tendency was detected for a similar quadratic response in 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk yield. Lower plasma insulin concentration may have resulted in lower body condition gain for cows fed diets with higher beet pulp concentration. Partial substitution of pelleted beet pulp for high-moisture corn decreased intake but also may have permitted greater fat-corrected milk yield.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of reducing forage particle length (FPL) and the inclusion of cottonseed hulls (CSH) on intake, digestibility, chewing activity, and milk production of cows in early lactation. Sixteen multiparous cows averaging 17 +/- 3 d in milk and 677 +/- 58 kg BW were assigned to one of four 4 x 4 Latin squares. One square contained ruminally cannulated cows to evaluate effects of treatment on rumen fermentation and function. During each of the 23-d periods, cows were offered one of four total mixed rations that differed in particle length (long or short corn silage) and CSH inclusion rate (0 or 8{\%} DM). Dietary treatments were: long no CSH (LGNH), long with CSH (LGH), short no CSH (SHNH), and short with CSH (SHH). Total physically effective NDF content, measured as percentage of NDF greater than 1.18 mm, was similar across diets, but mean particle length decreased with reducing FPL and inclusion of CSH. Dry matter intake was not significantly affected by FPL but was significantly increased with the inclusion of CSH. Decreasing FPL and the inclusion of CSH significantly increased neutral detergent fiber intake. Total chewing activity expressed as minutes per day was unaffected by FPL and the inclusion of CSH. Both eating and ruminating efficiency expressed as minutes per kilogram of neutral detergent fiber intake increased with increasing FPL and decreased with the inclusion of CSH. Milk production did not differ across treatments, but the inclusion of CSH significantly increased percent and yield of milk protein. Reducing FPL tended to reduce percentage milk fat but not yield. Mean ruminal pH was not affected by FPL but was highest on diets containing CSH, even though no treatment effects were observed on total VFA, acetate, or propionate concentration. These resuits indicate that corn silage FPL is a poor predictor of total chewing time and rumen pH but is useful in understanding factors affecting feeding behavior. In addition, the inclusion of CSH, resulted in increased rumination and mean rumen pH even though effects on VFA concentration were not observed.},

to explain the role that genomic imprinting has
played over the course of mammalian evolution, but
at present it is not clear if a single hypothesis

imprinted genes play. In this review, we discuss
efforts to define the extent of imprinting in the

loci may have been wrought by distinct evolutionary
forces. We focus on a group of small imprinted
domains, which consist of paternally expressed genes
embedded within introns of multiexonic transcripts,

abstract = {The objectives of this experiment were to determine the effects of oral Ca supplementation on milk yield, body condition, pregnancy per artificial insemination (P/AI), and days to pregnancy in Holstein cows considered to be of low (LRM; no calving assistance, live singleton without retained placenta) or high (HRM; at least one of the following: dystocia, twins, stillbirth, retained placenta, or vulvo-vaginal laceration) risk of developing metritis. The hypotheses were that oral Ca supplementation during the early postpartum period would reduce the loss of body condition and improve lactation performance and reproduction. Four hundred fifty Holstein cows were blocked by parity as primiparous cows (n = 174) or multiparous cows (n = 276). Within parity, a cow considered at HRM was matched with a cow of LRM and the pair was randomly assigned to control (no Ca supplementation), 86 g of Ca on d 0 and 1 postpartum (CaS1), or 86 g of Ca on d 0 and 1 postpartum followed by 43 g/d on d 2 to 4 postpartum (CaS4). Body condition was scored at calving and 32 d postpartum and estrous cyclicity was evaluated at 38 and 52 d postpartum. Milk yield was recorded daily. Multiparous cows were classified as above or below the mean 305-d mature equivalent milk yield based on production in the previous lactation. Reproductive performance was evaluated for the first 210 d postpartum. Body condition did not differ among treatments, and cows lost on average 0.44 units of body condition in the first month of lactation. Calcium supplementation did not affect milk yield in the first 5 mo postpartum. For multiparous cows, Ca supplementation was beneficial to milk yield in the first 30 DIM in cows of greater production potential, but detrimental to multiparous cows with below average production potential. Calcium supplementation to primiparous cows reduced P/AI at first (control = 55.8, CaS1 = 31.5, CaS4 = 37.0{\%}) and all artificial inseminations (control = 48.5, CaS1 = 34.6, CaS4 = 38.5{\%}); however, Ca supplementation to multiparous cows improved P/AI at the first (control = 32.1, CaS1 = 38.6, CaS4 = 41.3{\%}) and all artificial inseminations (control = 28.1, CaS1 = 35.3, CaS4 = 40.5{\%}). These responses in P/AI to Ca supplementation resulted in extended median days to pregnancy (control = 75, CaS1 = 100, CaS4 = 94 d) and smaller proportion of pregnant cows (control = 89.3, CaS1 = 83.9, CaS4 = 83.9{\%}) in primiparous cows, but shorter days to pregnancy (control = 115, CaS1 = 94, CaS4 = 94 d) and increased proportion of pregnant cows in multiparous cows (control = 67.0, CaS1 = 77.2, CaS4 = 74.3{\%}). Risk of metritis depressed most measures of reproduction evaluated in the experiment. Results indicate that responses to oral Ca supplementation are conditional on parity and production potential of cows. Oral Ca supplementation was detrimental to reproduction in primiparous cows. On the other hand, Ca supplementation benefited reproduction in multiparous cows and milk yield in the cohort of multiparous cows of greater production potential.},

abstract = {This study was designed to separate the effect of fermentation quality on voluntary intake of grass silage from other feed factors affecting intake. Variations in DMI were quantified, and the impact on intake was modeled. The relationships between individual silage components and intake were examined. A partially balanced changeover experiment with 30 Norwegian Red steers (137 +/- 16.4 kg of BW) was carried out to determine the intake of 24 silages and of hay harvested from the same parent crop within 60 h. Five forages were fed at a time in each of five 3-wk periods. Every 3-wk period was preceded by 2 wk of feeding a standard silage. Silage DMI ranged from 1.79 to 2.65, with a mean of 2.38 kg x 100 kg of BW(-1) x d(-1). Hay DMI averaged 2.43 kg x 100 kg of BW(-1) x d(-1). Ranges (mean) for the composition of silages were as follows: DM, 166 to 237 (213) g/kg; water-soluble carbohydrates, 16.3 to 70.9 (33.0) g/kg of DM; acetic acid, 11.5 to 64.7 (28.6) g/kg of DM; propionic acid, 0 to 5.2 (1.0) g/kg of DM; butyric acid, 0 to 25.1 (6.0) g/kg of DM; lactic acid, 2.2 to 102 (49.3) g/kg of DM; and NH3-N (not corrected for additive-derived N), 89.3 to 255 (153) g/kg of total N. Silage DMI was closely (P {\textless} 0.05) related to DM, ADL, VFA, lactic acid, total acids, the lactic acid:total acids ratio, ADIN, NH3-N (not corrected), histamine, tryptamine, cadaverine, and the total sum of amines (the explained variation in intake ranged from 14 to 53{\%}). The 2 best models describing silage DMI included concentrations in the silage of propionic acid, butyric acid, and lactic acid, and these models explained 75 and 84{\%} of the variation in DMI. The strong correlation (r = 0.84, P {\textless} 0.05) between total NH3-N and butyric acid concentrations in silages indicates that these variables described the same variation pattern. The inclusion of NH3-N in the equations describing the effect of fermentation quality on DMI of low-DM grass silage was less useful than that of butyric acid. This was due to the confounded relationship between the NH3-N concentration in silages and the use of ammonium-containing preservatives and to difficulties in correcting for the added ammonium.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Failure to expel fetal membranes within 24 h of calving is a pathological condition defined as retained placenta (RP). The objective of this investigation was to evaluate whether there are alterations in several selected serum variables related to innate immunity and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism that precede occurrence of RP in transition Holstein dairy cows. METHODS One hundred multiparous Holstein dairy cows were involved in the study. Blood samples were collected from the coccygeal vein during the -8 to +4 wks around parturition, once per week before the morning feeding. Six healthy control cows (CON) and 6 cows with RP were selected and serum samples at -8, -4, time of diagnosis of disease, and +4 wks relative to parturition were used for analyses. All samples were analyzed for lactate, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), haptoglobin (Hp), and serum amyloid A (SAA). RESULTS Cows with RP had greater concentrations of serum lactate, IL-1, IL-6, TNF, and SAA in comparison with CON cows. Intriguingly, elevated concentrations of all five variables were observed at -8 and -4 wks before the occurrence of RP compared to healthy cows. Cows with RP also had lower DMI and milk production vs CON animals; however milk composition was not affected by RP. CONCLUSIONS Cows with RP showed an activated innate immunity 8 wks prior to diagnosis of disease. Overall results suggest that serum IL-1, IL- 6, and TNF, and lactate can be used as screening biomarkers to indicate cows that might have health issues during the transition period.},

abstract = {{\{}T{\}}wo models can be used for studying binary results of {\{}AI{\}}. {\{}T{\}}he
additive threshold model proposes an underlying variable as summing
the environmental and genetic effects from the 2 individuals involved
in the mating, and the product threshold model assumes that the conditional
probability of {\{}AI{\}} success is the product of the probabilities of
success of 2 unobserved binary phenotypes (one is the male fertility;
the other is the female fertility). {\{}T{\}}he purpose of this paper is
to compare the predictive ability of the product and the additive
threshold models for studying {\{}AI{\}} results and to compare results
obtained with the 2 models in 3 different species: cattle, sheep,
and rabbits. {\{}R{\}}esults showed that the predictive ability of the
product model is similar to the additive model in sheep and rabbits
but worst in cattle (percentage of wrong prediction = 42, 27, and
35{\%} in the additive model; 43, 28, and 47{\%} in the product model in
sheep, rabbits, and cattle, respectively). {\{}E{\}}ven when the 2 models
have similar performance, they differed in their {\{}EBV{\}} (for instance,
{\{}P{\}}earson correlation between {\{}EBV{\}} predicted with the 2 models =
0.46 in sheep for male fertility). {\{}T{\}}he product model can determine
which sex is responsible for an {\{}AI{\}} failure. {\{}I{\}}n sheep, the female
was the responsible in 94{\%} of the cases and male in 2{\%} of them; in
rabbits, the female was the responsible in 54{\%} of the cases and the
male in 39{\%} of them. {\{}D{\}}ifferent estimates of probabilities for male
and female fertility success obtained with the product model in the
3 species suggest that male and female fertilities behave differently
depending on the species and the uniqueness of the data sets. {\{}A{\}}lthough
product model seems to provide additional information in the fertility
process, further research is needed to understand the worst performance
of the product model in cattle.},

Three hundred seventy-five fresh Holstein cows were blocked based on parity (143 cows in first parity, 108 cows in second parity, and 124 cows in third or greater parity) and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental treatments immediately after calving. Treatments were control group without infusion (control; n = 190); 1 s.c. infusion of 250 mL of 40{\%} Ca borogluconate (1SC250; n = 72) at calving; 1 s.c. infusion of 500 mL of 40{\%} Ca borogluconate (1SC500; n = 63) at calving; 2 s.c. infusions of 250 mL of 40{\%} Ca borogluconate, one immediately after calving and the second 12 to 18 h after first infusion (2SC250; n = 50). Blood samples were collected immediately after parturition and at 1, 2, 4, and 7 d in milk (DIM) for Ca, P, and Mg determination. Milk production, milk composition, and somatic cell count were recorded monthly up to 90 DIM. The evaluation of BCS was performed at calving and at 38 DIM. A subset of 9 cows per treatment group was randomly chosen to measure serum concentration of glucose and BHB at 2, 4, and 7 DIM. Total serum Ca in 1SC250 (8.95 mg/dL), 1SC500 (9.27 mg/dL), and 2SC250 (9.07 mg/dL) was greater during the first week postpartum compared with control (8.45 mg/dL). Serum concentrations of P, Mg, BHB, glucose, and milk yield were not affected by treatments. The dry matter intake during the first 24 h after calving was higher for treatments 1SC250 (13.5 kg), 1SC500 (15.0 kg), and 2SC250 (15.6 kg) relative to control (12.5 kg). Milk somatic cell counts were lower for 1SC500 (90.5 cells/mL) and 2SC250 (82.2 cells/mL) than control (132.8 cells/mL). Risk ratio was {\textgreater}1 for development of metritis, and clinical and subclinical endometritis in control cows relative to 2SC250 cows, which indicates a higher risk of developing disease for control cows (2.03, 1.7, and 1.8 times, respectively). These results suggest that prophylactic s.c. infusions of Ca at calving can improve postpartum Ca status in Holstein cows and intake at 1 DIM. Given the reduction of metritis, clinical and subclinical endometritis, and subclinical hypocalcemia with treatment, the effect of s.c. Ca supplementation on immune status warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {We present a statistical model for patterns of genetic variation in samples of unrelated individuals from natural populations. This model is based on the idea that, over short regions, haplotypes in a population tend to cluster into groups of similar haplotypes. To capture the fact that, because of recombination, this clustering tends to be local in nature, our model allows cluster memberships to change continuously along the chromosome according to a hidden Markov model. This approach is flexible, allowing for both "block-like" patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and gradual decline in LD with distance. The resulting model is also fast and, as a result, is practicable for large data sets (e.g., thousands of individuals typed at hundreds of thousands of markers). We illustrate the utility of the model by applying it to dense single-nucleotide-polymorphism genotype data for the tasks of imputing missing genotypes and estimating haplotypic phase. For imputing missing genotypes, methods based on this model are as accurate or more accurate than existing methods. For haplotype estimation, the point estimates are slightly less accurate than those from the best existing methods (e.g., for unrelated Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain individuals from the HapMap project, switch error was 0.055 for our method vs. 0.051 for PHASE) but require a small fraction of the computational cost. In addition, we demonstrate that the model accurately reflects uncertainty in its estimates, in that probabilities computed using the model are approximately well calibrated. The methods described in this article are implemented in a software package, fastPHASE, which is available from the Stephens Lab Web site.},

({\{}FA{\}}) composition, but no quantitative synthesis of

these studies is currently available. {\{}T{\}}his article

reports a meta-analysis of the response of cow milk

{\{}FA{\}} composition to oilseed lipid supplements from

linseed, rapeseed, soybeans, and sunflower

seed. {\{}F{\}}irst, from a database of 145 oilseed

supplementation experiments, we collected the mean

{\{}FA{\}} percentages observed with unsupplemented diets

and diets supplemented with the 4 oilseeds given as

seeds (after various types of processing), as oils

(including {\{}C{\}}a salts and amides), or in protected

forms. {\{}S{\}}econd, we studied the response of the major

milk {\{}FA{\}} percentages to increasing amounts of

supplemental lipids from the 4 oilseeds. {\{}R{\}}esponses

were nonsignificant, linear, or quadratic, depending

on the {\{}FA{\}} studied and the supplement. {\{}E{\}}ffects of

interfering factors, such as supplement form, forage

component of the diet, or lactation stage, were

difficult to assess from the available data. {\{}T{\}}hird,

we studied the response of the major milk {\{}FA{\}}

percentages to increasing dietary intakes of

linoleic or linolenic acids, taken

separately. {\{}O{\}}verall, these results confirm the high

plasticity of milk {\{}FA{\}} composition, with the widest

variations being observed in the percentages of

medium-chain versus {\{}C{\}}18 {\{}FA{\}}, and among the {\{}C{\}}18 in

18:0, cis-18:1, and trans-18:1. {\{}T{\}}he percentages of

the polyunsaturated {\{}FA{\}} cis-9 cis-12-18:2 and 18:3

were less variable, except when protected lipids

(mostly formaldehyde treated) were

supplied. {\{}H{\}}owever, trans-18:1 and polyunsaturated {\{}FA{\}}

(including conjugated linoleic acid) exhibited the

greatest variations when expressed relative to their

respective basal values (for unsupplemented

diets). {\{}O{\}}ils, compared with seeds, induced greater

percentages of trans-18:1 and tended to decrease {\{}C{\}}6

to {\{}C{\}}12 {\{}FA{\}} more. {\{}I{\}}ntakes of 18:2- and 18:3-rich lipid

sources did not differ greatly in their effects on

short- and medium-chain {\{}FA{\}} and trans-18:1

percentages, although the profiles of individual

18:1 and 18:2 isomers in milk differed. {\{}T{\}}his

abstract = {The main objective of this study was to develop practical models to assess and predict the adequacy of dietary fiber in high-yielding dairy cows. We used quantitative methods to analyze relevant research data and critically evaluate and determine the responses of ruminal pH and production performance to different variables including physical, chemical, and starch-degrading characteristics of the diet. Further, extensive data were used to model the magnitude of ruminal pH fluctuations and determine the threshold for the development of subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). Results of this study showed that to minimize the risk of SARA, the following events should be avoided: 1) a daily mean ruminal pH lower than 6.16, and 2) a time period in which ruminal pH is {\textless}5.8 for more than 5.24 h/d. As the content of physically effective neutral detergent fiber (peNDF) or the ratio between peNDF and rumen-degradable starch from grains in the diet increased up to 31.2 +/- 1.6{\%} [dry matter (DM) basis] or 1.45 +/- 0.22, respectively, so did the daily mean ruminal pH, for which a asymptotic plateau was reached at a pH of 6.20 to 6.27. This study also showed that digestibility of fiber in the total tract depends on ruminal pH and outflow rate of digesta from reticulorumen; thereby both variables explained 62{\%} of the variation of fiber digestibility. Feeding diets with peNDF content up to 31.9 +/- 1.97{\%} (DM basis) slightly decreased DM intake and actual milk yield; however, 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk and milk fat yield were increased, resulting in greater milk energy efficiency. In conclusion, a level of about 30 to 33{\%} peNDF in the diet may be considered generally optimal for minimizing the risk of SARA without impairing important production responses in high-yielding dairy cows. In terms of improvement of the accuracy to assessing dietary fiber adequacy, it is suggested that the content of peNDF required to stabilize ruminal pH and maintain milk fat content without compromising milk energy efficiency can be arranged based on grain or starch sources included in the diet, on feed intake level, and on days in milk of the cows.},

abstract = {The effects of a grain-based subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) challenge (GBSC) and an alfalfa-pellet SARA challenge (APSC) on fermentation and endotoxins in the rumen and in the cecum, as well as on endotoxins in peripheral blood, were determined. Six nonlactating Holstein cows with cannulas in the rumen and cecum were used in the study. A 3×3 Latin square arrangement of treatments with 4-wk experimental periods was adopted. During the first 3 wk of each experimental period, all cows received a diet containing 70{\%} forages [dry matter (DM) basis]. In wk 4 of each period, cows received 1 of the following 3 diets: the 70{\%} forage diet fed during wk 1 to 3 (control), a diet in which 34{\%} of the dietary DM was replaced with grain pellets made of 50{\%} ground wheat and 50{\%} ground barely (GBSC), or a diet in which 37{\%} of dietary DM was replaced with pellets of ground alfalfa (APSC). Rumen pH was monitored continuously using indwelling pH probes, and rumen fluid, blood, cecal digesta, and fecal grab samples were collected immediately before feed delivery at 0900 h and at 6 h after feed delivery on d 3 and 5 of wk 4. The time for which rumen pH was below 5.6 was 56.4, 225.2, and 298.8 min/d for the control, APSC, and GBSC treatments, respectively. Compared with the control, SARA challenges resulted in similar reductions in cecal digesta pH, which were 7.07, 6.86, and 6.79 for the control, APSC, and GBSC treatments, respectively. Compared with the control, only GBSC increased starch content in cecal digesta, which averaged 2.8, 2.6, and 7.4{\%} of DM for the control, APSC, and GBSC, respectively. Free lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) concentration in rumen fluid increased from 10,405 endotoxin units (EU)/mL in the control treatment to 30,715 and 168,391 EU/mL in APSC and GBSC, respectively. Additionally, GBSC increased the LPS concentration from 16,508 to 118,522 EU/g in wet cecal digesta, and from 12,832 to 93,154 EU/g in wet feces. The APSC treatment did not affect LPS concentrations in cecal digesta and feces. All concentrations of LPS in blood plasma were below the detection limit of {\textgreater}0.05 EU/mL of the technique used. Despite the absence of LPS in blood, only GBSC increased the concentration of LPS-binding protein in blood plasma, which averaged, 8.9, 9.5, and 12.1mg/L for the control, APSC, and GBSC treatments, respectively. This suggests that GBSC caused translocation of LPS from the digestive tract but that LPS was detoxified before entering the peripheral blood circulation. The higher LPS concentration in cecal digesta in the GBSC compared with the APSC suggests a higher risk of LPS translocation in the large intestine in GBSC than in APSC.},

abstract = {The physical form of forage may influence rumen development and, consequently, the body weight gain, dry matter (DM) consumption, digestibility, and welfare of dairy calves. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of 2 different physical forms of forage on performance, apparent digestibility, and feeding behavior of young calves. Twenty Holstein male calves (46.8±1.2kg) were randomly assigned at birth to 1 of 2 feeding treatments in which they were exposed to a mixed ration containing (on a DM basis) 90{\%} crumb starter concentrate and either (1) 10{\%} coarsely chopped (3 to 4cm) grass hay (CRS; n=10) or (2) 10{\%} finely ground (2mm) grass hay (FN; n=10). All calves were offered 8L/d of milk replacer (MR; 1.2kg of DM) from birth; the amount of MR was progressively reduced after 5wk to enable weaning by the end of wk 7. The study finished after wk 8. Consumption of the mixed ration, MR, and water was recorded daily, and calves were weighed twice weekly. Samples of feed and orts were taken in wk 7 and 8 for nutrient content analysis. Behavioral data for each calf were obtained for 2h/d during wk 6 and 8, for a total observation time per animal of 28h. Total feces were collected during wk 8 to determine apparent digestibility. Calves fed CRS had greater DM intake than those fed FN (2.70 vs. 2.45±0.11kg/d, respectively) during the week after weaning (wk 8). Body weight gain was similar between treatments; however, calves fed CRS tended to have a greater gain-to-feed ratio than calves fed FN (0.68 vs. 0.63±0.02kg of gain/kg of DM intake). No differences were observed in crude protein and acid detergent fiber consumption between treatments; however, calves fed CRS tended to consume more neutral detergent fiber than calves fed FN during the last week of the study (719.2 vs. 610.5±25.84g/d). Calves receiving CRS sorted in favor of neutral detergent fiber to a greater extent than calves consuming FN, whereas calves fed FN sorted in favor of crude protein to a greater extent than calves fed CRS. Apparent DM, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber digestibility values were greater in calves fed CRS than in those fed FN (72.3, 77.4, 40.7, and 42.7{\%} vs. 69.2, 74.5, 34.0, and 35.6{\%}, respectively). Calves fed FN spent more time performing nonnutritive oral behaviors than those fed CRS, and calves fed FN tended to spend less time idle (either lying or standing) than those fed CRS. In conclusion, providing chopped hay to young calves improved feed intake, DM, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber digestibility values during the week after weaning, and reduced nonnutritive oral behaviors compared with offering ground hay.},

Experimental periods were 21d, with 18d of diet adaptation and 3 d of sample collection. Treatments were (1) control (no supplemental fat), (2) high-palmitic acid (PA) supplement (84{\%} C16:0), and (3) Ca salts of palm fatty acid (FA) supplement (Ca-FA). The PA supplement had no effect on milk production, but decreased dry matter intake by 7 and 9{\%} relative to the control in high- and low-producing cows, respectively, and increased feed efficiency by 8.5{\%} in high-producing cows compared with the control. Milk fat concentration and yield were not affected by PA relative to the control in high- or low-producing cows, although PA increased the yield of milk 16-C FA by more than 85g/d relative to the control. The Ca-FA decreased milk fat concentration compared with PA in high-, but not in low-producing cows. In agreement, Ca-FA dramatically increased milk fat concentration of trans-10 C18:1 and trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid ({\textgreater}300{\%}) compared with PA in high-producing cows, but not in low-producing cows. No effect of treatment on milk protein concentration or yield was detected. The PA supplement also increased 16-C FA apparent digestibility by over 10{\%} and increased total FA digestibility compared with the control in high- and low-producing cows. During short-term feeding, palmitic acid supplementation did not increase milk or milk fat yield; however, it was efficiently absorbed, increased feed efficiency, and increased milk 16-C FA yield, while minimizing alterations in ruminal biohydrogenation commonly observed for other unsaturated fat supplements. Longer-term experiments will be necessary to determine the effects on energy balance and changes in body reserves.},

The difference between F2 progeny being heterozygous Qq and qQ (first allele is paternally derived) for grandpaternal Q and grandmaternal q alleles was genome-wide significant for the traits liver weight and spleen weight with a paternal imprinting effect at 1 cM on proximal chromosome 11. Suggestive imprinting effects (chromosome-wide error probability less than 0.05) were found for the traits body weight, liver weight, and kidney weight, and were located on chromosome 14 at 25 cM, 23 cM, and 32 cM, respectively. A genome-wide significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for spleen weight at 26 cM slightly failed the suggestive significance level for imprinting. The effect was consistently maternal for all these traits on chromosome 14. Further suggestive imprinting effects were found for abdominal fat percentage on chromosome 3, for spleen weight on chromosome 5, and for liver weight on chromosome X. Our results are supported by a likely imprinting in a human genome region with homology to mouse chromosome 14 and agree well with the known imprinting of proximal chromosome 11 in the mouse.},

abstract = {Interaction between genes, or epistasis, is found to
be common and it is a key concept for understanding
adaptation and evolution of natural populations,
response to selection in breeding programs, and
determination of complex disease. Currently, two
independent classes of models are used to study
epistasis. Statistical models focus on maintaining
desired statistical properties for detection and
estimation of genetic effects and for the
decomposition of genetic variance using average
effects of allele substitutions in populations as
parameters. Functional models focus on the
evolutionary consequences of the attributes of the
genotype-phenotype map using natural effects of
allele substitutions as parameters. Here we provide
a new, general and unified model framework: the
natural and orthogonal interactions (NOIA)
model. NOIA implements tools for transforming
genetic effects measured in one population to the
ones of other populations (e.g., between two
experimental designs for QTL) and parameters of
statistical and functional epistasis into each other
(thus enabling us to obtain functional estimates of
QTL), as demonstrated numerically. We develop
graphical interpretations of functional and
statistical models as regressions of the genotypic
values on the gene content, which illustrates the
difference between the models--the constraint on the
slope of the functional regression--and when the
models are equivalent. Furthermore, we use our
theoretical foundations to conceptually clarify
functional and statistical epistasis, discuss the
advantages of NOIA over previous theory, and stress
the importance of linking functional and statistical
models. },

These anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria are naturally present in the intestinal flora of mammals, but their uncontrolled multiplication under certain conditions results in the overproduction of toxins in the intestinal tract. Major clinical signs are induced by the systemic spread of these toxins in the blood and tissues. Enterotoxaemia may be acute or peracute, and sudden death is often reported in rapidly growing, apparently healthy cattle. Enterotoxaemia can be prevented only with better understanding of its risk factors and pathogenesis. This paper provides an up-to-date overview of knowledge concerning the aetiology of the syndrome, its epidemiological context, pathogenesis, clinical signs and lesions, the diagnostic procedures and prophylactic tools, with specific attention to field aspects that are directly relevant to practitioners and clinical researchers.},

In each 21-d period, cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments (values on a dry matter basis): (1) control (CON) that contained 0{\%} DDGS; (2) DG contained 30{\%} DDGS; (3) RFDG contained 30{\%} RFDDGS in substitution of DDGS; and (4) RFDG+RIF was similar to RFDG with the addition of 1.9{\%} RIF. Unlike most practical diets in the dairy field, our diets had {\textless}22{\%} forage neutral detergent fiber and {\textgreater}18.0{\%} crude protein. Dry matter intake was similar across treatments with any form of DDGS averaging 26.0±0.6kg/d, whereas the CON diet resulted in less dry matter intake, 21.6±0.6kg/d. Milk yield tended to be 1.7kg/d greater for diets with either type of DDGS. Concentration of milk protein was greatest for the DG and RFDG diets, intermediate for the RFDG+RIF diet, and least for the CON diet, namely 3.22, 3.21, 3.12, and 3.07±0.05{\%}. Reduced milk fat percentage and yield were observed when cows consumed the DG diet, 3.27±0.10{\%} and 1.11±0.04kg/d, respectively, whereas these responses were similar among CON, RFDG, and RFDG+RIF, which averaged 3.68±0.10{\%} and 1.22±0.04kg/d. The presence of trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid was only detected in milk from cows consuming the DG diet; similarly, concentration and yield of trans-10 18:1 were greater for cows consuming this diet. Rumen ammonia was similar across treatments averaging 27.0±2.1mg/dL. The CON and RFDG+RIF diets had similar mean pH, 6.1±0.11, whereas DG and RFDG resulted in lower pH averaging 5.79±0.11. No effect on total concentration of volatile fatty acids was observed; the overall mean was 121±4.11mM; molar proportion of acetate was affected by treatment resulting in 67.3, 63.2, 61.4, and 60.9±0.93mol/100mol for CON, RFDG+RIF, RFDG, and DG, respectively. Results from DNA sequencing showed that rumen bacterial community structure was relatively stable with minor changes at the family and genus levels; these changes may be associated with low starch diets, and hence reduced amylolytic bacteria populations. Feeding high proportions of RFDDGS resulted in greater dry matter intake with low risk for milk fat depression while supporting ruminal fermentation.},

abstract = {Shortening the dry period (DP) has been proposed as a management strategy to improve energy balance in early lactation. It is well known that both shortening and complete omission of the DP reduces milk production in the subsequent lactations. In most of these studies milk production data were obtained from planned animal experiments where cows were randomly assigned to DP length treatments, and cow management and diet composition did not differ among treatments. It may therefore be hypothesized that cows on commercial herds which apply a no-DP or short-DP-strategy, and support this by management adjustments, will have a less dramatic reduction in milk production. In this study, milk production and somatic cell count (SCC) following different DP lengths was investigated under commercial circumstances. Milk production of 342 cows (2,077 test-day records) was available from 5 Dutch commercial dairy herds which started a no DP-strategy for all cows. Test days of the year before applying the no-DP strategy are used as control (323 cows, 1,717 test-day records). Six other herds applied an individual cow approach and have different preplanned DP lengths within one herd. From these herds, information on 81 cows (482 test-day records) with a DP length between 0 and 20 d, 127 cows (925 test-day records) with a DP length between 21 and 35 d, and 143 cows (1,075 test-day records) with a DP length of more than 35 d was available. A generalized linear model incorporating an autoregressive covariance structure accounting for repeated test-day yields within cow was developed to estimate the daily yield (milk, fat and protein) and SCC of all cows. Applying no DP for all cows in the herd resulted in a reduction in postpartum milk production compared with within-herd control lactations (until 305 DIM) between 3.2 and 9.1 kg/d, which was a reduction of 12 and 32{\%}, respectively. For the 6 herds that applied an individual cow approach with different preplanned DP lengths, the cow-specific DP strategy was based on milk production and SCC approximately 2 mo before calving. Cows with a preplanned DP length ranging between 0 and 20 d had a reduction in postpartum milk production between 5.7 and 13 kg/d compared with cows with a DP length of {\textgreater}35 d. Cows with a preplanned DP length ranging from 21 to 35 d had a numerically lower milk production (between 0.6 and 5.3 kg/d) than cows with a preplanned DP length of {\textgreater}35 d, but this difference was significant in only one herd. When corrected for milk yield, no difference in postpartum SCC for cows with different DP lengths was found.},

abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the dangers of using haplotypes reconstructed directly from population data for a fine-scale mapping analysis. Family data may help resolve ambiguity, yet can be costly to obtain. This study is concerned with the following question: How much family data (if any) should be used to facilitate haplotype reconstruction in a population study? We conduct a simulation study to evaluate how changes in family information can affect the accuracy of haplotype frequency estimates and phase reconstruction. To reconstruct haplotypes, we introduce an EM-based algorithm that can efficiently accommodate unrelated individuals, parent-child trios, and arbitrarily large half-sib pedigrees. Simulations are conducted for a diverse set of haplotype frequency distributions, all of which have been previously published in empirical studies. A wide variety of important results regarding the effectiveness of using pedigree data in a population study are presented in a coherent, unified framework. Insight into the different properties of the haplotype frequency distribution that can influence experimental design is provided. We show that a preliminary estimate of the haplotype frequency distribution can be valuable in large population studies with fixed resources.},

abstract = {In this report, we compared haplotyping approaches using families and unrelated individuals on the simulated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) data in Problem 3 from Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW) 15. To investigate these two approaches, we picked two representative programs: PedPhase and fastPHASE, respectively, for each approach. PedPhase is a rule-based method focusing on the haplotyping constraints within each pedigree and solving them using integer linear programming. fastPHASE is a statistical method based on the clustering property of haplotypes in a population over short regions. It is believed that with family information, one can obtain more accurate phasing results with considerably more cost for genotyping additional family members. Our results indicate that, though only relying on the constraints within each family (with four members) individually, PedPhase has better phasing accuracy than fastPHASE, even when the total numbers of genotyped individuals are the same. But for missing genotype imputation, fastPHASE performs better than PedPhase by taking population information into consideration. The relative influence of family constraints and population information on haplotyping accuracy as shown in this report provides some empirical bases on assessing the trade-off of genotyping family data under different settings.},

abstract = {Diets that contain high amounts of K induce milk fever by alkalinizing the blood of the cow, reducing the ability of homeostatic mechanisms to maintain normal blood concentrations of Ca. The addition of anions to the diet induces metabolic acidosis, which counteracts the alkalinizing effect of the high cation diets commonly fed to cows. Currently, anions are usually added as anionic salts, such as CaCl2 or MgSO4, and the pH of urine is often monitored to assess the degree of metabolic acidification resulting from the addition of anions to the diet. An alternative source of anions is HCl. In Experiment 1, the addition of HCl to the diet of cows that were not pregnant and not lactating significantly reduced the pH of urine and blood within 24 h. After HCl was removed from the diet, the pH of urine returned to baseline levels within 48 h. In Experiment 2, the inclusion of HCl into the prepartum ration of Jersey cows entering the third or greater lactation significantly reduced the incidence of milk fever from 63{\%} of control cows to 11{\%} of the treated cows and also reduced the degree of hypocalcemia that was experienced by the cows during the periparturient period. Plasma Ca concentrations at 0.5 d after calving were 5.33 +/- 0.52 and 6.69 +/- 0.51 mg/dl in the control and the HCl-treated cows, respectively. In Experiment 2, the prepartum consumption of the ration with HCl was greater than the consumption of the control ration. In liquid form, HCl remains dangerous to handle and corrosive to machinery. Commercial preparations of HCl mixed into common feed ingredients as a premix could offer an inexpensive and palatable alternative to anionic salts as a means of controlling the incidence of milk fever in dairy cows.},

abstract = {Previous investigations have shown that cobalt (Co) modifies milk fat composition in cattle, consistent with an inhibition of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity, but it remains unclear whether other ruminant species are also affected. The present study examined the effects of oral administration of Co acetate on intake, rumen function, and milk production and fatty acid (FA) composition in sheep. Twenty lactating Assaf ewes were allocated into 1 of 4 groups and used in a continuous randomized block design that involved a 15-d adaptation, a 6-d treatment, and a 10-d posttreatment period. During the treatment period, animals received an oral drench supplying 0 (control), 3 (Co3), 6 (Co6), and 9 (Co9) mg of Co/kg of BW per day, administered in 3 equal doses at 8-h intervals. Cobalt acetate had no influence on intake or milk fat and protein concentrations, whereas treatments Co6 and Co9 tended to lower milk yield. Results on rumen parameters showed no effects on rumen fermentation, FA composition, or bacterial community structure. Administration of Co acetate decreased milk concentrations of FA containing a cis-9 double bond and SCD product:substrate ratios, consistent with an inhibition of SCD activity in the ovine mammary gland. Temporal changes in milk fat composition indicated that the effects of treatments were evident within 3d of dosing, with further changes being apparent after 6d and reverting to pretreatment values by d 6 after administration. Effect on milk FA composition did not differ substantially in response to incremental doses of Co acetate. On average, Co decreased milk cis-9 10:1/10:0, cis-9 12:1/12:0, cis-9 14:1/14:0, cis-9 16:1/16:0, cis-9 17:1/17:0, cis-9 18:1/18:0, and cis-9,trans-11 18:2/trans-11 18:1 concentration ratios by 30, 32, 38, 33, 21, 24, and 25{\%}, respectively. Changes in milk fat cis-9 10:1, cis-9 12:1, and cis-9 14:1 concentrations to Co treatment indicated that 51{\%} of cis-9 18:1 and cis-9,trans-11 18:2 secreted in milk originated from $\Delta$(9)-desaturation. In conclusion, results demonstrated the potential of oral Co administration for the estimation of endogenous synthesis of FA containing a cis-9 double bond in the mammary gland of lactating ruminants. Indirect comparisons suggest that the effects of Co differ between sheep and cattle.},

H) concentrate diet without (LC, HC) added oil or

kg/d, respectively, across treatments. Plasma
acetate and {\{}beta{\}}-hydroxybutyrate decreased,
whereas glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, and
leptin increased with high-concentrate diets. Milk
fat percentage was lower in cows fed
high-concentrate diets (2.31 vs. 3.38), resulting in
decreases in yield of 11 (HC) and 42{\%}
(HCO). Reduced yields of 8:0-16:0 and cis9-18:1
fatty acids accounted for 69 and 17{\%}, respectively,
of the decrease in milk fat yield with HC vs. LC
(-90 g/d), and for 26 and 33{\%}, respectively, of the
decrease with HCO vs. LCO (-400 g/d). Total
trans-18:1 yield increased by 25 (HCO) and 59 (LCO)
g/d with oil addition. Trans10-18:1 yield was 5-fold
greater with high-concentrate diets. Trans11-18:1
increased by 13 (HCO) and 19 (LCO) g/d with oil
addition. Trans13+14-18:1 yield increased by 9 (HCO)
and 18 (LCO) g/d with linseed oil. Yield of total
conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) in milk averaged 6
g/d with LC or HC compared with 14 g/d with LCO or
HCO. Cis9,trans11-CLA yield was not affected by
concentrate level but increased by 147{\%} in response
to oil. Feeding oil increased yields of
trans11,cis13-, trans11,trans13-, and
trans,trans-CLA, primarily with
LCO. Trans10,cis12-CLA yield (average of 0.08 g/d)
was not affected by treatments. Yield of
trans11,cis15-18:2 was 1 g/d in cows fed LC or HC
and 10 g/d with LCO or HCO. Yields of
cis9,trans11-18:2, cis9,trans12-18:2, and
cis9,trans13-18:2 were positively correlated (r =
0.74 to 0.94) with yields of trans11-18:1,
trans12-18:1, and trans13+14-18:1,
respectively. Plasma concentrations of
biohydrogenation intermediates with concentrate or
linseed oil level followed similar changes as those
in milk fat. Milk fat depression was observed when
HC induced an increase in trans10-18:1 yield. A
correlation of 0.84 across 31 comparisons from 13
published studies, including the present one, was
found among the increase in percentage of
trans10-18:1 in milk fat and decreased milk fat

abstract = {High-producing dairy cows experience a sudden and significant increase in energy requirements due to the onset of milk production in early lactation. They mobilize body reserves, mainly adipose tissue, resulting in an increased risk of production decline and the development of health disorders. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of feeding oilseeds (rapeseed) during the dry period, thereby priming dairy cows for metabolism of body fat in early lactation. Forty-three Holstein dairy cows were used, 14 were primiparous and 29 were multiparous (≥2nd lactation). In the dry period, 8 wk before expected calving until calving, the cows were fed either a diet with a high content of rapeseed in the total mixed ration (HF) or a standard total mixed ration with a low content of fat (CON). During the first 5 wk after calving, all the cows were fed a standard low fat lactation ration. The treatments were evaluated by performance and metabolic variables in blood and liver. The dry period diet had no effects on body weight and body condition score of the cows during the dry period and in early lactation. The daily yield of milk, protein, and lactose did not differ among treatments. However, the milk fat concentration was lower and the daily milk fat production tended to be lower for the cows fed the HF diet in the dry period compared with the cows fed the CON diet. The plasma content of nonesterified fatty acids, cholesterol, and phospholipids in the dry period was increased in the HF dry period diet compared with the CON diet. The lower plasma concentration of uric acid obtained prepartum for the cows fed the HF diet may indicate a lower rumen microbial protein synthesis. Postpartum, the plasma concentration of $\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid tended to be lower for the cows fed the HF dry period diet. The liver content of triglycerides was lower and the liver content of glycogen was higher in early lactation among the cows fed the HF dry period diet compared with the cows fed the CON diet. Based on liver glycogen, triglyceride content, and blood $\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid concentration, it could be argued that intake of oilseeds during the dry period is a positive strategy for priming dairy cows for fat metabolism in the following early lactation.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effects of plant species (red clover vs. timothy-meadow fescue) and forage maturity at primary harvest (early vs. late cut silage) on rumen fermentation, nutrient digestion, and nitrogen metabolism including omasal canal AA flow and plasma AA concentration in lactating cows. Five dairy cows equipped with rumen cannulas were used in a study designed as a 5 x 5 Latin square with 21-d periods. The diets consisted of early-cut and late-cut grass and red clover silage, respectively, and a mixture of late-cut grass and early-cut red clover silages given ad libitum with 9 kg/d of a standard concentrate. Grass silage dry matter intake tended to decrease but that of red clover silages tended to increase with advancing maturity. Milk yields were unchanged among treatments, milk protein and fat concentrations being lower for red clover than for grass silage diets. Rumen fluid pH was unchanged but volatile fatty acid and ammonia concentrations were higher for red clover than for grass silage diets. Intake of N, and omasal canal flows of total nonammonia N (NAN), microbial NAN, and dietary NAN were higher for red clover than for grass silage diets but were not affected by forage maturity. However, microbial NAN flow and amount of N excreted in the feces decreased with advancing maturity for grass diets but increased for red clover diets. Apparent ruminal N degradability of the diets was unchanged, but true ruminal N degradability decreased and efficiency of microbial synthesis increased with red clover diets compared with grass silage diets. Omasal canal flows of AA, except those for Met and Cys, were on average 20{\%} higher for red clover than grass silage diets. Omasal canal digesta concentrations of Leu, Phe, branched-chain, and essential AA were higher but those of Met lower for red clover than for grass silage diets. Plasma AA concentrations, except for His (unchanged) and Met (lower), were higher for red clover than for grass diets. However, none of these AA-related variables were affected by forage maturity. Total digestibility of N and excretion of N in the urine were higher for red clover than for grass diets and decreased with advancing maturity. It was concluded that despite the higher total AA supply of cows fed red clover versus grass silage diets, further milk production responses on red clover diets were compromised by an inadequate supply of Met as evidenced by lower Met concentration in the AA profile of omasal digesta and plasma.},

abstract = {Feeding rumen-protected fat (RPF) can improve energy supply for dairy cows but it affects glucose metabolism. Glucose availability is a precondition for high milk production in dairy cows. Therefore, this study investigated endocrine regulation of glucose homeostasis and hepatic gene expression related to glucose production because of RPF feeding in lactating cows. Eighteen Holstein dairy cows during second lactation were fed either a diet containing RPF (mainly C16:0 and C18:1; FD; n = 9) or a control diet based on corn starch (SD; n = 9) for 4 wk starting at 98 d in milk (DIM). Feed intake and milk yield were measured daily and milk composition once a week. Blood samples were taken weekly for analyses of plasma triglyceride, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, bilirubin, urea, lactate, glucose, insulin, and glucagon. At 124 DIM, an intravenous glucose tolerance test (GTT; 1g/kg of BW(0.75)) was performed after a 12-h period without food. Blood samples were taken before and 7, 14, 21, and 28 min after glucose administration, and plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, and glucagon were measured. Glucose half-life as well as areas under the concentration curve for glucose, insulin, and glucagon were calculated. After slaughter at d 28 of treatment, liver samples were taken to measure mRNA abundance of pyruvate carboxylase, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and facilitative glucose transporter 2. Dry matter intake, but not energy and protein intake, was lower in FD than in SD. Milk yield during lactation decreased more in SD than in FD, and milk protein was lower in FD than in SD. Plasma concentrations of triglycerides and NEFA were higher in FD than in SD. Plasma insulin concentrations were lower and the glucagon:insulin ratios were higher in FD than in SD. Fasting glucose concentration before GTT was lower, and fasting glucagon concentrations tended to be higher in FD than in SD. In liver, fat content tended to be higher and G6Pase mRNA abundance was lower in FD than in SD. Lower hepatic G6Pase mRNA abundance was associated with reduced fasting plasma glucose concentrations, but the glucose-induced insulin response was not affected by RPF feeding. Hepatic G6Pase gene expression might be affected by DMI and might be involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in dairy cows, resulting in a lower hepatic glucose output after RPF feeding.},

abstract = {We previously reported that supplementation of rumen-protected choline (RPC) reduces the hepatic triacylglycerol concentration in periparturient dairy cows during early lactation. Here, we investigated the effect of RPC on the transcript levels of lipid metabolism-related genes in liver and adipose tissue biopsies, taken at wk -3, 1, 3, and 6 after calving, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this RPC-induced reduction of hepatic lipidosis. Sixteen multiparous cows were blocked into 8 pairs and randomly allocated to either 1 of 2 treatments, with or without RPC. Treatments were applied from 3wk before to 6wk after calving. Both groups received a basal diet and concentrate mixture. One group received RPC supplementation, resulting in an intake of 14.4g of choline per day, whereas controls received an isoenergetic mixture of palm oil and additional soybean meal. Liver and adipose tissue biopsies were taken at wk -3, 1, 3, and 6 to determine the mRNA abundance of 18 key genes involved in liver and adipose tissue lipid and energy metabolism. Milk samples were collected in wk 1, 2, 3, and 6 postpartum for analysis of milk fatty acid (FA) composition. The RPC-induced reduction in hepatic lipidosis could not be attributed to altered lipolysis in adipose tissue, as no treatment effect was observed on the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$, lipoprotein lipase, or FA synthase in adipose tissue, or on the milk FA composition. Rumen-protected choline supplementation increased the expression of FA transport protein 5 and carnitine transporter SLC22A5 in the liver, suggesting an increase in the capacity of FA uptake and intracellular transport, but no treatment effect was observed on carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A, transporting long-chain FA into mitochondria. In the same organ, RPC appeared to promote apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein assembly, as shown by elevated microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression and apolipoprotein B100 expression. Cows supplemented with RPC displayed elevated levels of glucose transporter 2 mRNA and a reduced peak in pyruvate carboxylase mRNA immediately after calving, showing that supplementation also resulted in improved carbohydrate metabolism. The results from this study suggest that RPC supplementation reduces liver triacylglycerol by improved FA processing and very-low-density lipoprotein synthesis, and RPC also benefits hepatic carbohydrate metabolism.},

abstract = {The objective was to evaluate the relative efficacy of a novel, commercially available disinfectant agent (T-Hexx Dragonhyde HBC, Hydromer, Branchburg, NJ) compared with formalin and copper sulfate. The hypothesis was 2 sided; therefore, the hypothesis was that the new agent would be better or worse compared with the industry gold standard footbath agents, formalin and copper sulfate. The study was conducted in a large commercial dairy farm located near Ithaca, New York, from June 18, 2009 to October 26, 2009. Two identical studies were conducted, the first comparing Dragonhyde (5{\%} solution, twice weekly) and formalin (5{\%} solution, twice weekly) and the second comparing Dragonhyde (5{\%} solution, twice weekly) and copper sulfate (10{\%} solution, twice weekly). The study design was identical for both studies with 4 pens (physically identical), 2 treatments (Dragonhyde vs. formalin and Dragonhyde vs. copper sulfate), 2 periods (crossing over the treatment within pen), and 3 repeated measures (3 observations per cow: enrollment, wk 2, and wk 4). For study 1, 406 cows were enrolled (n=201 formalin and 205 Dragonhyde). For study 2, 356 cows were enrolled (n=189 copper sulfate and 167 Dragonhyde). The adjusted odds of digital dermatitis lesion (DDL) throughout the study period were analyzed by mixed logistic regression model. In study 1, the odds of DDL were 1.36 times higher for the formalin group compared with the Dragonhyde group. In study 2, the data were analyzed by a similar statistical model and the variable treatment did not significantly affect the overall prevalence of DDL. In conclusion, the performance of 3 hoof care products was evaluated and it was concluded that Dragonhyde performed better than formalin and that there was no difference between copper sulfate and Dragonhyde.},

abstract = {The objectives were to study the effects of induced subclinical hypocalcemia [SCH, blood ionized Ca (iCa(2+)) {\textless}1.0mM, without recumbency] on physiological responses and function of immune cells in dairy cows. Ten nonpregnant, nonlactating Holstein cows were blocked by lactation and assigned randomly to a normocalcemic (NC; intravenous infusion of 0.9{\%} NaCl i.v. plus 43g of oral Ca, as Ca sulfate and Ca chloride, at -1 and 11h) or an induced SCH [SCHI, 5{\%} ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a selective iCa(2+) chelator, intravenous infusion] treatment for 24h, using a crossover design. The sequence of treatments was either NC-SCHI or SCHI-NC, with a 6-d washout period. Ionized Ca was evaluated before, hourly during the infusion period, and at 48 and 72h, to monitor concentrations and adjust the rate of infusion, maintaining blood iCa(2+) {\textless}1.0mM in SCHI throughout the 24-h infusion period. Additional measurements included heart and respiratory rates, rectal temperature, dry matter intake, rumen contractions, whole-blood pH, concentrations of glucose and K in whole blood, concentrations of total Ca, Mg, nonesterified fatty acids, $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, and insulin in plasma, and urinary excretion of Ca. Total and differential leukocyte count in blood was also performed. The concentration of cytosolic iCa(2+) in neutrophils and lymphocytes was quantified and neutrophil function was assayed in vitro. Infusion of a 5{\%} EGTA solution successfully induced SCH in all SCHI cows, resulting in decreased blood iCa(2+) concentrations throughout the 24-h treatment period (0.77±0.01 vs. 1.26±0.01mM iCa(2+)). Induction of SCH reduced dry matter intake on the day of infusion (5.3±0.8 vs. 9.1±0.8kg/d) and rumen contractions (1.9±0.2 vs. 2.7±0.2 contractions/2min) for the last 12h of infusion. Cows in SCHI had decreased plasma insulin concentration (1.44±0.23 vs. 2.32±0.23ng/mL) evident between 6 and 18h after the beginning of the infusion, accompanied by increased concentrations of glucose (4.40±0.04 vs. 4.17±0.04mM). Plasma nonesterified fatty acids concentration was greater for SCHI than NC cows (0.110±0.019 vs. 0.061±0.014mM). Neutrophils of cows in SCHI had a faster decrease in cytosolic iCa(2+) after stimulation with ionomycin (9.9±1.0 vs. 13.6±1.4 Fluo-4:Fura Red post-end ratio) in vitro. Furthermore, induction of SCH reduced the percentage of neutrophils undergoing phagocytosis (22.1±2.1 vs. 29.3±2.1{\%}) and reduced the oxidative burst response after incubation of pathogenic bacteria (16.1±1.7 vs. 24.2±1.7{\%}). Subclinical hypocalcemia compromised appetite, altered metabolism, and impaired function of immune cells in dairy cows.},

abstract = {This experiment evaluated the effect of feeding a lower starch diet (21{\%} of dry matter) with different amounts of forage (52, 47, 43, and 39{\%} of dry matter) on lactational performance, chewing activity, ruminal fermentation and turnover, microbial N yield, and total-tract nutrient digestibility. Dietary forage consisted of a mixture of corn and haycrop silages, and as dietary forage content was reduced, chopped wheat straw (0-10{\%} of dry matter) was added in an effort to maintain chewing activity. Dietary concentrate was adjusted (corn meal, nonforage fiber sources, and protein sources) to maintain similar amounts of starch and other carbohydrate and protein fractions among the diets. Sixteen lactating Holstein cows were used in replicated 4 × 4 Latin squares with 21-d periods. Dry matter intake increased while physically effective neutral detergent fiber (peNDF1.18) intake was reduced as forage content decreased from 52 to 39{\%}. However, reducing dietary forage did not influence milk yield or composition, although we observed changes in dry matter intake. Time spent chewing, eating, and ruminating (expressed as minutes per day or as minutes per kilogram of NDF intake) were not affected by reducing dietary forage. However, addition of chopped wheat straw to the diets resulted in greater time spent chewing and eating per kilogram of peNDF1.18 consumed. Reducing dietary forage from 52 to 39{\%} did not affect ruminal pH, ruminal digesta volume and mass, ruminal pool size of NDF or starch, ruminal digesta mat consistency, or microbial N yield. Ruminal acetate-to-propionate ratio was reduced, ruminal turnover rates of NDF and starch were greater, and total-tract digestibility of fiber diminished as dietary forage content decreased. Reducing the dietary forage content from 52 to 39{\%} of dry matter, while increasing wheat straw inclusion to maintain chewing and rumen function, resulted in similar milk yield and composition although feed intake increased. With the lower starch diets in this short-term study, the minimal forage content to maintain lactational performance was between 39 and 43{\%}.},

abstract = {Reproductive information since 1995 from the USDA national dairy database was used to calculate yearly Holstein and Jersey means for days to first breeding after calving (DFB), 70-d nonreturn rate, conception rate (CR), number of breedings per lactation (NB), interval between first and last breedings during the lactation, days to last breeding after calving (DLB), pregnancy rate (PR), calving interval (CI), and interval between consecutive breedings. Data were from nearly 20 million breedings during {\textgreater}8 million lactations of {\textgreater}5 million cows in {\textgreater}23,000 herds. Means were also calculated for some traits by parity and breeding number for both breeds and by geographical region and synchronization status for Holsteins. The DFB declined for Holsteins from 92 d in 1996 to 85 d in 2007; the trend in yearly differences was not as consistent for Jerseys. First- and all-breeding 70-d nonreturn rate declined 5 to 9 percentage units over time. First- and all-breeding CR declined 2 to 4 percentage units. The DFB were longer for later parities of Holsteins than for early parities. Second- and third-breeding CR were sometimes 1 to 2 percentage units above first-breeding CR for Holsteins but lower (1 to 7 percentage units) for Jerseys. The CR within breeding number declined across parities for both breeds. The NB increased by 0.3 to 0.4 breedings over time but remained constant (2.5 or 2.6 breedings) across parities for Holsteins and increased (from 2.2 to 2.4 breedings) for Jerseys. Holstein DFB were fewest in the Northwest (78 d) and greatest in the Mountain region (92 d). Regional CR was highest for the Northeast and Southwest (33{\%}) and lowest for the Southeast (26{\%}); NB was fewest for the Northeast (2.3) and greatest for the Southeast (2.7). Mean DLB was fewest for the Southwest (127 d) and greatest for the Mountain region (157 d); CI was shortest for the Southwest (406 d) and longest for the Mideast (434 d). Mean PR was highest for the Southwest (28.3{\%}) and lowest for the Mideast and Southeast (22.2{\%}). Use of timed artificial insemination following synchronized estrus appears to have reduced DFB, lowered CR, and increased NB while reducing DLB and CI. However, synchronized breeding was not a primary cause of Holstein regional differences for reproductive traits. Since 2002, phenotypic performance for CR, DLB, and CI as well as genetic merit for daughter PR have stopped their historical declines and started to improve.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the effects of Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract (Amaferm) on the in vitro ruminal fermentation of coastal bermudagrass, soluble starch and amino acids. Mixed ruminal microorganisms were incubated in anaerobic media for either 24 h (Amaferm alone, soluble starch, amino acids) or 48 h (bermudagrass). Amaferm was added to the incubation bottles (n = 4) at concentrations of 0, .4 or 1.0 g/liter. When mixed ruminal microorganisms were incubated with only Amaferm, the 1.0 g/liter concentration increased the production of hydrogen (H2; P less than .001), methane (CH4; P less than .01), acetate (P less than .05), butyrate (P less than .01), total VFA (P less than .05) and NH3 (P less than .05). Addition of both levels of Amaferm to soluble-starch fermentations tended to enhance the production of H2 (P less than .11), CH4 (P less than .15), acetate (P less than .29) and total VFA (P less than .19); propionate production was increased (P less than .10) by 1.0 g/liter Amaferm, resulting in a decrease (P less than .05) in the acetate:propionate ratio. Fermentation of amino acids plus 1.0 g/liter Amaferm enhanced the production of acetate (P less than .05), propionate (P less than .05), valerate (P less than .01) and total VFA (P less than .10) and decreased the acetate:propionate ratio (P less than .05). In addition, NH3 production tended (P less than .19) to increase with both levels of Amaferm. When bermudagrass was the substrate, few changes in fermentation products were observed with Amaferm treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {This study evaluated the effect of diets containing sorghum silages with higher (HT) and lower-tannin (LT) concentrations supplemented with concentrate or urea on intake, digestibility, ruminal digestibility, methane emission and rumen parameters in beef cattle. Four treatments were distributed according to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement in a duplicate 4 × 4 Latin square: LT sorghum silage + urea, LT sorghum silage + concentrate, HT sorghum silage + urea, and HT sorghum silage + concentrate. Total digestibility of the organic matter was higher when concentrate was included in the diet (0.749 and 0.753 in the LT and HT treatments, respectively). It was observed lower ruminal apparent digested matter of neutral detergent fiber in HT diets. There was no effect of tannin levels on digestibility and methane emission. The supplementation with concentrate in the LT diet decreased gas losses as a function of gross energy intake in comparison to the supplementation of the diet with urea. These results suggest the potential of concentrate supplementation to minimize energy loss as methane emission by ruminants and increase the efficiency of energy utilization. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Negative energy balance is a known risk factor for decreased fertility in dairy cows. This study evaluated the accuracy of plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-factors related to negative energy balance-in predicting decreased fertility. One plasma sample per cow was collected from 480 cows in 12 herds during the period from d 4 to 21 in milk and analyzed for NEFA, BHBA, and IGF-1. For each cow, data on breed, parity, calving date, gynecological examinations, and insemination dates were obtained. Milk samples from 241 cows in 7 of the participating herds were analyzed for progesterone concentration to define the first day of luteal activity. The diagnostic sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) at different cut-off concentrations of NEFA, BHBA, or IGF-1 were calculated and related to individual cow fertility status, measured as anestrus (ANEST), delayed first artificial insemination (DFAI), or delayed conception. Positive and negative predictive values (PV+; PV-) were calculated considering different levels of (within-herd) prevalence. Strata (i.e., sub-group)-specific Se and Sp and associations between test results and fertility parameters were investigated using logistic regression. The NEFA and BHBA tests for ANEST and DFAI had the highest combined Se and Sp and were thus evaluated further. Cut-off values with Sp around 80{\%} were used in this step to provide a reasonable number of test-positive cows, representing a practical situation. This corresponded to a cut-off value for the NEFA test of 400 µEq/L (Se 0.27-0.45) and for the BHBA test of 1.8 mM (Se 0.15-0.30) across all cows included in the study. The estimated Sp was generally higher than the original 80{\%}, but the corresponding Se was further decreased when the test was used in heifers compared with older cows. The true prevalence of ANEST in the study population was 27{\%}, which gave a PV+ of 0.36 to 0.45 and a PV- of 0.76 to 0.79. With 35{\%} true prevalence of DFAI, PV+ was 0.29 to 0.38 and PV- was 0.64 to 0.66. Thus, overall test performance was low when metabolic indicators measured as single values in early lactation were used to predict fertility in dairy cows, but accuracy was influenced by cow-level factors such as parity. The prevalence of the target condition (in this case, decreased fertility) also influences test usefulness and should be considered when planning test systems and interpreting test results.},

abstract = {Dairy calves are increasingly fed large volumes of milk, which reduces feeding motivation and improves weight gain. However, calves often show signs of hunger and lose weight when weaned off milk due to low starter intake. We examined whether delaying the age at weaning would reduce responses to weaning. Calves were raised in groups of 9 and fed milk, starter, hay, and water with automated feeders. In each group, 3 calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) low-milk, early-weaned: fed 6 L/d of milk and weaned at 47 d of age; (2) high-milk early-weaned: fed 12 L/d of milk and weaned at 47 d; (3) high-milk later-weaned: fed 12 L/d of milk and weaned at 89 d of age. Milk, starter, and hay intakes were recorded daily and digestible energy (DE) intake estimated. Feeder visits were recorded. Before weaning, the high-milk calves drank more milk, ate less starter and hay, but had higher DE intakes, gained more weight, and made fewer visits to the milk feeder than the low-milk, early-weaned calves. During and immediately after weaning, the high-fed, early-weaned calves ate less starter and hay, had lower DE intakes, and gained less weight than the low-milk, early-weaned calves and lost their body weight advantage 7 d after weaning. During and immediately after weaning, the high-milk, later-weaned calves ate more starter and hay and had higher DE intakes, higher weight gains, and made fewer visits to the milk feeder than the high-milk, early-weaned calves. They were still heavier than the low-milk, early-weaned calves 18 d after weaning. Delaying the age at which calves are weaned off milk reduces the drop in energy intake and behavioral signs of hunger that result from weaning.},

associated with greater flows of cis9,trans11-

37 g/d in cows fed LC and increased to 81 g/d with
HC. Feeding oil increased total trans-18:1 to the
greatest extent with HCO. Flow of trans10-18:1 was
lower with LC than with HC (1.46 vs. 20
g/d). Linseed oil increased trans11-18:1 flow by 40
(LCO) to 113 g/d (HCO). Feeding LCO and HCO also
increased flows of trans6+7+8-, trans13+14-,
trans15-, and trans16-18:1. Apparent intestinal
digestibility of trans-18:1 isomers was largely
unaffected by concentrate level and ranged between
67 and 95{\%}. Linseed oil increased digestibility of
nearly all isomers by 3 to 16 percentage
units. Digestibility of cis9,trans11-CLA was greater
in cows fed HC (55{\%}) compared with cows fed LC
(32{\%}) and was not affected by linseed oil. Data
suggest that high concentrate diets enhanced ruminal

abstract = {Increasingly, feed additives for livestock, such as amino acids and vitamins, are being produced by Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli. The potential therefore exists for animals, consumers and workers to be exposed to possibly harmful amounts of endotoxin from these products. The aim of this review was to assess the extent of the risk from endotoxins in feed additives and to calculate how such risk can be assessed from the properties of the additive. Livestock are frequently exposed to a relatively high content of endotoxin in the diet: no additional hazard to livestock would be anticipated if the endotoxin concentration of the feed additive falls in the same range as feedstuffs. Consumer exposure will be unaffected by the consumption of food derived from animals receiving endotoxin-containing feed, because the small concentrations of endotoxin absorbed do not accumulate in edible tissues. In contrast, workers processing a dusty additive may be exposed to hazardous amounts of endotoxin even if the endotoxin concentration of the product is low. A calculation method is proposed to compare the potential risk to the worker, based on the dusting potential, the endotoxin concentration and technical guidance of the European Food Safety Authority, with national exposure limits.},

abstract = {Bovine mammary parenchyma (PAR) and fat pad (MFP) development are responsive to preweaning level of nutrient intake. We studied transcriptome alterations in PAR and MFP from Holstein heifer calves (n=6/treatment) fed different nutrient intakes from birth to ca. 65 d age. Conventional nutrient intake received 441 g of dry matter (DM)/d of a control milk replacer (MR) [CON; 20{\%} crude protein (CP), 20{\%} fat, DM basis]. Calves in the accelerated nutrition groups received 951 g/d of high-protein/low-fat MR (HPLF; 28{\%} CP, 20{\%} fat, DM basis), 951 g/d of high-protein/high-fat MR (HPHF; 28{\%} CP, 28{\%} fat, DM basis), or 1,431 g/d of HPHF (HPHF+) MR. Out of 13,000 genes evaluated, over 1,500 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were affected (false discovery rate {\textless}0.10) by level of nutrient intake in PAR or MFP. Feeding HPLF versus CON resulted in the most dramatic changes in gene expression, with 278 and 588 DEG having ≥1.5-fold change in PAR and MFP. In PAR, the most-altered molecular functions were associated with metabolism of the cell (molecular transport and lipid metabolism) with most of the genes downregulated in HPLF versus CON. In MFP, DEG also were primarily associated with metabolism but changes also occurred in genes linked to cell morphology, cell-to-cell signaling, and immune response. Compared with CON, feeding HPHF or HPHF+ did not result in substantial additional effects on DEG beyond those observed with HPLF. The pentose phosphate, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ubiquinone biosynthesis pathways were among the most enriched due to HPLF versus CON in PAR and were inhibited, whereas glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, and eicosanoid synthesis pathways were among the most enriched due to HPLF versus CON in MFP and were inhibited. These responses suggest that, in PAR, doubling nutrient intake from standard feeding rates inhibited energy metabolism and activity of oxidative pathways that partly serve to protect cells against oxidative stress. The MFP in those heifers appeared to decrease production of lipid-derived metabolites that may play roles in signaling pathways within the adipocyte. Overall, results indicated that prepubertal/preweaned mammary transcriptome is responsive to long-term enhanced nutrient supply to achieve greater growth rates before weaning. The biological significance of these results to future milk production remains to be elucidated.},

abstract = {Management practices during the periparturient period have been the focus of much research recently because during this period immune function, metabolism, and health of cows are severely challenged. Responses to stress are often classified as behavioral, immunological, neuroendocrine, and autonomic. In production systems, understanding all facets of stress response is important to correctly predict the consequences of stressors to the health and performance of animals and to prevent costly managerial changes that have minimal effect on animal well-being and performance. Common social stressors faced by periparturient animals are regrouping, overstocking, and for nulliparous animals, commingling with parous animals. In conventional dairies, feeding strategies during the periparturient period often require several group changes during the most challenging period of an animal's life. Traditional weekly regrouping of prepartum cows increases competitive behavior at the feed bunk but it does not affect immune and metabolic responses, health and production, as long as stocking density is not overwhelming, and nulliparous and parous animals are housed separately. Stocking density of prepartum animals may be overlooked because these are nonproductive animals. Severe overstocking (200{\%} of feeding space) of commingled nulliparous and parous pregnant animals produces neuroendocrine and metabolic changes. On the other hand, when prepartum nulliparous and parous animals are housed separately, stocking densities of up to 120{\%} do not seem to affect innate and adaptive immunity, metabolic responses, milk yield, and reproductive performance, despite increasing negative behavior among cows. In recent experiments, when animals were ranked based on feed bunk displacement, dominant animals were more likely to be diagnosed with metritis than subordinate animals. Importantly, dominant animals with large number of interactions with pen mates (displacement at the feed bunk) were considerably more likely to be diagnosed with uterine diseases (retained placenta and metritis) and to be removed from the herd within 60d postpartum. Much has been learned about behavioral responses of cows to stressful conditions, but our understanding of neuroendocrine and immune responses to such conditions is somewhat limited. A multidisciplinary approach to research that encompasses several responses to stress and biological functions is critical.},

abstract = {A meta-analysis of the potential effect of forage provision on growth performance and rumen fermentation of dairy calves was conducted using published data from the literature (1998–2016). Meta-regression was used to evaluate the effects of different forage levels, forage sources, forage offering methods, physical forms of starter, and grain sources on the heterogeneity of the results. We considered 27 studies that reported the effects of forage provision to dairy calves. Estimated effect sizes of forage were calculated on starter feed intake, average daily gain (ADG), feed efficiency (FE), body weight (BW), and rumen fermentation parameters. Intake of starter feed, ADG, BW, ruminal pH, and rumen molar proportion of acetate increased when supplementing forage but FE decreased. Heterogeneity (the amount of variation among studies) was significant for intake of starter feed, ADG, FE, final BW, and rumen fermentation parameters. Improving overall starter feed intake was greater in calves offered alfalfa hay compared with those offered other types of forages. During the milk feeding and overall periods, improving ADG was greater for calves fed a high level of forage ({\textgreater}10{\%} in dry matter) compared with those fed a low level of forage (≤10{\%} in dry matter) diets. The advantages reported in weight gain at a high level of forage could be due to increased gut fill. Improving overall ADG was lower for calves offered forages with textured starter feed compared with ground starter feed. The meta-regression analysis revealed that changes associated with forage provision affect FE differently for various forage sources and forage offering methods during the milk-feeding period. Forage sources also modulated the effect of feeding forage on ruminal pH during the milk-feeding period. In conclusion, forage has the potential to affect starter feed intake and performance of dairy calves, but its effects depend on source, level, and method of forage feeding and physical form of starter feed independently of grain sources included in the starter feed.},

abstract = {The objectives of this observational study were to use time-lapse video photography to document dairy cow behavioral patterns, examine factors affecting lying behavior, and to develop guidelines for visual assessment of free-stall usage during summer conditions in a high producing dairy. Four video cameras were placed in a free-stall pen containing 144 stalls and 129 high producing cows. The videos were recorded over a 6-d period in July 1999 and then were reviewed using 60-min scan sampling techniques. Cows were counted as lying, standing in alley without eating, standing in free stalls, or eating in each of the four sections of the pen. Temperature probes were placed on the feedline, free stalls, on both ends of the pen, and at an outside location. Relationships between proportion eligible lying and ambient temperature, feeding time, and time since milking were examined. Proportion eligible lying was equal to number of cows lying divided by total number of cows lying or standing but not eating. Cattle showed a significant pattern of temporal cyclicity in their lying behavior, with the highest average proportion of eligible cows lying at 6:00 a.m. (85{\%}) and the lowest at 9:00 p.m. (53{\%}). Increasing environmental temperatures and time elapsed since milking negatively impacted proportion of eligible cows observed lying when evaluated using 60-min scan sampling techniques.},

abstract = {The supplementation of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) to the rations of dairy cows represents an opportunity to reduce the content of milk fat. Therefore, CLA have the potential beneficial effect of reducing energy requirements of the early lactating cow. The present study aimed at the examination of long-term and posttreatment effects of dietary CLA intake on performance, variables of energy metabolism-like plasma levels of non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and fatty acid profile in milk fat. Forty-six pregnant German Holstein cows were assigned to one of three dietary treatments: (1) 100 g/ d of control fat supplement (CON), (2) 50 g/d of control fat supplement and 50 g/ d of CLA supplement (CLA-1) and (3) 100 g/d of CLA supplement (CLA-2). The lipid-encapsulated CLA supplement consisted of approximately 10{\%} of trans-10, cis-12 CLA and cis-9, trans-11 CLA each. The experiment started 1 d after calving and continued for about 38 weeks, divided into a supplementation (26 weeks) and a depletion period (12 weeks). Over the first 7 weeks of treatment, 11 and 16{\%} reductions in dry matter intake compared to control were observed for the cows fed CLA-1 and CLA-2 supplements respectively. Consequently, the calculated energy balance for these two CLA groups was lower compared to the control. Plasma levels of NEFA and BHB remained unaffected. Later in lactation the highest CLA supplementation resulted in a reduction of milk fat content of 0.7{\%}. However, no reduction in milk fat yield, and accordingly no milk fat depression (MFD), could be shown. The trans-10, cis-12 CLA in milk fat increased with increasing dietary CLA supplementation in a dose-dependent manner. The proportion of C16 in milk fat was decreased by the highest CLA supplementation. With the exception of an increase in plasma glucose level in the CLA-2 group, no post-treatment effects were observed. Overall, under the conditions of the present study no improvement in the calculated energy balance by CLA supplementation could be shown for the entire evaluation period.},

Milk fat composition is strongly influenced by stage of lactation; proportion of short chains (de novo synthesis) is low initially and increases until at least 8 to 10 wk into lactation. Milk fat composition is changed more by the amount and composition of dietary fat than any other dietary component. Seasonal and regional differences in milk fat composition are measurable, most likely because of local differences in feed supplies. Milk fat composition can be modified readily by changing the feeding regimen. The most significant changes in milk fat quality relate to rheological (melting) properties, which influence numerous aspects of character and quality of manufactured dairy products. Dietary fat fed to change milk fat composition may also influence contents of protein, urea, citrate, and soluble calcium in milk and influence oxidative stability and flavor. It is important for both dairy nutritionists and dairy food chemists to understand the consequences of feeding programs on milk quality.},

abstract = {We present CVMHAPLO, a probabilistic method for haplotyping in general pedigrees with many markers. CVMHAPLO reconstructs the haplotypes by assigning in every iteration a fixed number of the ordered genotypes with the highest marginal probability, conditioned on the marker data and ordered genotypes assigned in previous iterations. CVMHAPLO makes use of the cluster variation method (CVM) to efficiently estimate the marginal probabilities. We focused on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the evaluation of our approach. In simulated data sets where exact computation was feasible, we found that the accuracy of CVMHAPLO was high and similar to that of maximum-likelihood methods. In simulated data sets where exact computation of the maximum-likelihood haplotype configuration was not feasible, the accuracy of CVMHAPLO was similar to that of state of the art Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) maximum-likelihood approximations when all ordered genotypes were assigned and higher when only a subset of the ordered genotypes was assigned. CVMHAPLO was faster than the MCMC approach and provided more detailed information about the uncertainty in the inferred haplotypes. We conclude that CVMHAPLO is a practical tool for the inference of haplotypes in large complex pedigrees.},

abstract = {The concentration of biogenic amines (mono-, di- and polyamines) in silage and in the rumen, body tissues and body fluids mainly depends on the crop at harvest, the ensiling process, the silage and the digestion in the animal. Both the synthesis and the chemical structure of mono- and diamines are well documented. The basis for their formation is proteolysis, a naturally occurring process during ensilage, comprising the enzymatic decarboxylation of amino acids by the action of plant proteases and peptidases and of enzymes of various lactic acid bacteria (LAB), clostridia and other genera. Recent research has already delivered detailed knowledge about proteolysis, but the biochemical effects of biogenic amines in ruminants, including their impact on dry matter (DM) intake (DMI) by influencing sensory characteristics or post-ingestive feedback of the feed has not been elucidated. Data on effects of biogenic amines on palatability and their possible impacts on animal performance are scarce. However, some studies have been performed concerning the influence of biogenic amines on DMI, mainly with the quantitatively most relevant amines histamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine. Studies differed greatly with regard to type of administration (supplemented to silage, provided orally in capsules or infused in the gastrointestinal tract via ruminal cannulas), dosages (2-40. g amine/kg DM) and mixtures (single doses or various combinations of amines; combinations of amines with aldehydes, organic acids or keto-acids). Single doses and low-level doses showed no effect on DMI, whereas higher concentrations naturally not occurring in silage and combinations like histamine and formaldehyde revealed an appetite-reducing effect. Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), a non-protein amino acid often classified into the category of amines has also been studied. The conflicting results in terms of the impact of GABA on DMI may result from the administration of non-protected versus rumen-protected GABA and the differing modes of action of the two forms in the hypothalamus. In this review the results of research into the effects of different levels of amines in silages from different crops and ensiling treatments including the use of additives as well as the consideration of possible reasons for variation in the concentration of amines in silage are evaluated. Approaches for elucidating the possible impact on ruminant feed intake and level of production are also discussed. For an overall understanding of amine formation during ensilage further investigations with emphasis on correlations between the impact of ensiling and storage conditions and extent of amine formation are recommended to reveal relations between cause and effect.},

abstract = {Raw or extruded blends of ground canola seeds and canola meal were used to compare in vitro and in situ lag times and rates of disappearance due to ruminal biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids. The in situ study resulted in higher lag times for biohydrogenation for polyunsaturated fatty acids and lower rates of biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids than the in vitro study, so the in situ biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids was not complete at 24 h of incubation. With both methods, rates of biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids were higher than for cis-delta9C18:1. Extrusion did not affect the rate of biohydrogenation of cis-delta9C18:1, but resulted in higher rates of biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids with higher proportions of trans intermediates of biohydrogenation at 4 h of incubation in vitro and at 8 h of incubation in situ. These results suggest that extrusion affects the isomerization of polyunsaturated fatty acids, rather than the hydrogenation steps. In conclusion, in vitro and in situ methods can both show differences of ruminal metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids due to processing, but the methods provide very different estimates of the rates of disappearance due to biohydrogenation.},

The basal ration was composed of corn and grass silages (2:1 respectively, DM basis) and straight feeds. Cows commenced the study at wk 7 of lactation and remained on treatment for 16 wk. An interaction existed between Cu source and added S and Mo on DM intake, with cows offered INORG- Cu having an increased intake compared with those offered INORG+ or ORG- Cu. Milk yield averaged 35.4 kg/d, and was 5{\%} higher with milk fat content 6{\%} lower in cows fed INORG compared with ORG Cu, but milk fat yield, energy-corrected milk yield, and milk protein content did not differ between treatments. A trend existed for cows to have a higher body weight gain when offered ORG compared with INORG Cu. Cows fed diets containing INORG Cu had a higher milk concentration of C17:0 and C18:3n-3 compared with those fed diets containing ORG Cu. Cows fed added S and Mo had a lower milk concentration of C17:0 and C18:0 compared with those that were not supplemented. No effect was observed of dietary treatment on plasma Cu concentration, which averaged 13.1 $\mu$mol/L, except during wk 12 when cows receiving added S and Mo had a lower concentration. No effect was observed of Cu source on mean plasma Mo concentrations, but during wk 16 cows offered INORG Cu had a higher concentration than those offered ORG Cu. Hepatic Cu levels decreased by approximately 0.9 mg/kg of DM per day when fed additional S and Mo, but no effect of Cu source was observed. A trend existed for hepatic ATPase, Cu++ transporting, beta polypeptide (ATP7B) to be upregulated in cows when fed S and Mo along with ORG but not INORG Cu. In conclusion, the inclusion of an ORG compared with an INORG source of Cu reduced milk yield but increased milk fat concentration and body weight gain, with no effect on energy-corrected milk yield. Little effect was observed of dietary Cu supply on plasma mineral concentration, liver mRNA abundance, or milk fatty acid profile, whereas the addition of S and Mo reduced hepatic Cu concentrations.},

abstract = {Twenty Jersey cows were fed one of four prepartal diets: a)low calcium, low phosphorus (LCLP); b) low calcium, high phosphorus (LCLP); c) high calcium, low phosphorus (HCLP); or d)high calcium, high phosphorus (HCHP). Diets were fed for about 4 weeks prepartum. Blood samples were taken periodically, and the collected plasma analyzed for concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, hydroxyproline and 1,25 dihydroxyergocalciferol plus 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2D). Cows fed the LCLP and LCHP diets, when compared to cows fed the HCLP diet, had: a) greater concentrations of plasma 1,25-(OH)2D and hydroxyproline prepartum; b) greater plasma calcium concentrations at parturition; and c) less incidence (0 versus 4 cases) of parturient paresis. Thus, low calcium diets, regardless of dietary phosphorus intake, seemed to activate calcium homeostatic mechanisms before parturition by stimulating both bone and gut. Cows fed the HCLP diet had greater plasma calcium concentrations at parturition than did cows fed the HCHP, even though there was no measurable effect on plasma 1,25-(OH)2D and hydroxyproline concentrations during the prepartal period. It seems possible that the beneficial effect of low dietary phosphorus, when dietary calcium is high, may be a result of a prepartal increase in efficiency of absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the gut caused by increased binding of 1,25-(OH)2D to intestinal receptors.},

abstract = {Ensiling legumes allows conservation of high-quality forage. However, severe protein degradation occurs during ensiling of legumes. A field study was carried out in 1999 on sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop) to investigate the effects of wilting and mechanical conditioning on proteolysis in wilted herbage and silage. The herbage was cut with both a rubber roll conditioning machine (C) and with a mower without conditioner (U). It was wilted in the field to three dry matter (DM) levels (220, 330 and 440 g kg -1 ) and ensiled in laboratory glass silos. The herbages and the silages were analysed for ensilability characteristics, fermentation quality and nitrogen fractions. During wilting the non-protein nitrogen (NPN) values increased (p  {\textless}  0.05) in both U and C treatment. The free amino acid (free AA) values increased (p  {\textless}  0.05) from 2.4 to 1.2.9 and from 2.4 to 7.2 mol kg -1  total nitrogen, in the U and C treatments, respectively. Low wilted silages (DM content  {\textless} 320 g kg -1 ) underwent butyric acid fermentation and extensive proteolysis in both treatments, with lower (p  {\textless}  0.05) NPN and free AA values in the C treatment. Mechanical conditioning may limit protein breakdown and catabolism of some essential amino acids by reducing the field wilting time in both sainfoin wilted herbage and silage. {\textcopyright} 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.},

In perioden dat de dieren niet worden beweid is circa 70{\%} van de droge stof in het voer van melkvee afkomstig uit kuilvoer. Dit betreft voornamelijk graskuilen en snijma{\"{i}}skuilen. In ongeveer 10{\%} van de graskuilen en 1{\%} van de snijma{\"{i}}skuilen worden additieven toegepast met als doel de fermentatie te stimuleren en/of het a{\"{e}}roob bederf te reduceren. Naar aanleiding van gewijzigde EU wetgeving op het gebied van additieven voor kuilvoer zijn in deze deskstudie risico's van deze additieven voor de kwaliteit en veiligheid van melk ge{\"{i}}nventariseerd. In 2010 is vernieuwde wetgeving van kracht geworden voor additieven in diervoeder (European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003). Hierin is opgenomen dat additieven voor diervoeder alleen mogen worden toegepast, wanneer hiervoor vergunning verleend is. Ook zijn richtlijnen voor verpakking en etikettering vastgelegd. Vergunningen worden voor een periode van 10 jaar verleend. Kuiltoevoegmiddelen vallen onder deze regeling en zijn gedefinieerd als substanties, inclusief enzymen of micro-organismen, bedoeld om te worden opgenomen in het diervoeder om de kwaliteit van kuilvoer te verbeteren. Er is een register op internet waarin de toegestane middelen zijn gepubliceerd. Kuiltoevoegmiddelen stimuleren een goede ontwikkeling van de kuil waarbij suikers afkomstig uit het gewas door aanwezige melkzuurbacteri{\"{e}}n worden gefermenteerd tot organische zuren. In combinatie met het lage zuurstof gehalte in de kuil zorgt dit voor een goede conservering en daarmee een lange bewaartijd. Diverse soorten melkzuurbacteri{\"{e}}n, zoals Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactobacillus casei, Pediococcus acidilactici, Pediococcus pentosaceus, kunnen worden toegepast om de fermentatie te stimuleren. Enzymen, zoals (hemi-)cellulases, xylanases, amylases en glucanases, worden toegepast om de beschikbaarheid van fermenteerbare suikers te vergroten of NIZO-Rapport E 2011/231 pag. 3 van 18 het vezelgehalte van de kuil te verlagen. Diverse organische (mierenzuur, benzo{\"{e}}zuur), maar ook anorganische zuren (zoutzuur, zwavelzuur) kunnen worden toegevoegd voor conservering.

({\{}AMS{\}}), a certain amount of concentrate pellets is

provided while the cow is being milked. {\{}I{\}}f the

milking frequency in an {\{}AMS{\}} is increased, the intake

of concentrate pellets might increase

accordingly. {\{}R{\}}eplacing conventional starchy pellets

with nonstarchy pellets increased milk yield, milk

fat, and milk protein and decreased body weight. {\{}T{\}}he

hypothesis was that a nonroughage by-product rich in

digestible neutral detergent fiber, such as soyhulls

and gluten feed, could replace starchy grain in

pellets fed in an {\{}AMS{\}}. {\{}S{\}}ixty cows were paired by

age, milk yield, and days in milk, and were fed a

basic mixture ad libitum [16.2 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.35 (mean

{\{}+/-{\}} {\{}SE{\}}) kg of dry matter intake/d per cow] plus a

pelleted additive (6 to 14 kg of dry matter/d per

cow) that was consumed in the {\{}AMS{\}} and in a

concentrate self-feeder, which could only be entered

after passing through the {\{}AMS{\}}. {\{}T{\}}he 2 feeding

regimens differed only in the composition of the

pelleted additives: the control group contained

52.9{\%} starchy grain, whereas the experimental group

contained 25{\%} starchy grain, plus soyhulls and

gluten feed as replacement for part of the

grain. {\{}W{\}}heat bran in the control ration, a source of

fiber with low digestibility, was replaced with more

digestible soyhulls and gluten. {\{}D{\}}uring the first 60

d in milk, a cow received 10 to 12 kg of concentrate

pellets. {\{}A{\}}fter 60 {\{}DIM{\}}, concentrate feed was

allocated by milk production: [{\&}le;]25 kg/d of milk

entitled a cow to 2 kg/d of concentrate feed; {\textgreater}25

kg/d of milk entitled a cow to receive 1 kg/d of

additional concentrate feed per 5 kg/d of additional

milk production, and {\textgreater}60 kg/d of milk entitled a cow

to receive 9 kg of concentrate. {\{}T{\}}he concentrate feed

was split between the {\{}AMS{\}} and concentrate

self-feeder. {\{}T{\}}he 2 diets resulted in similar

frequencies of voluntary milking (3.12 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.03 to

2.65 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.03 visits/d per cow vs. 3.16 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.00

to 2.60 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.01 visits/d per cow). {\{}A{\}}verage milk

yields were higher in the experimental group (42.7

{\{}+/-{\}} 0.76 to 39.09 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.33 kg/d per cow

vs. 39.69 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.68 to 37.54 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.40 kg/d per

cow) and percentages of milk protein (3.02 {\{}+/-{\}}

0.06 to 3.12 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.05{\%} vs. 3.07 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.04 to 3.20

{\{}+/-{\}} 0.04{\%}) and milk fat (3.42 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.17 to 3.44

{\{}+/-{\}} 0.08{\%} vs. 3.38 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.13 to 3.55 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.06{\%})

were similar in the 2 groups. {\{}T{\}}he results suggest

that the proposed pellets high in digestible neutral

detergent fiber can be allocated via the {\{}AMS{\}} to

selected high-yielding cows without a negative

effect on appetite, milk yield, or milk composition

while maintaining a high milking frequency. },

abstract = {Use of feed antibiotics as growth promoters for control of pathogens associated with monogastric food animal morbidity and mortality has contributed to the development of antimicrobial resistance, which has now become a threat to public health on a global scale. Presently, a number of alternative feed additives have been developed and are divided into two major categories, including 1) the ones that are supposed to directly and indirectly control pathogenic bacterial proliferation; and 2) the other ones that are intended to up-regulate host gut mucosal trophic growth, whole body growth performance and active immunity. A thorough review of literature reports reveal that efficacy responses of current alternative feed additives in replacing feed antibiotics to improve performances and gut health are generally inconsistent dependent upon experimental conditions. Current alternative feed additives typically have no direct detoxification effects on endotoxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and this is likely the major reason that their effects are limited. It is now understood that pathogenic bacteria mediate their negative effects largely through LPS interactions with toll-like receptor 4, causing immune responses and infectious diseases. Therefore, disruptive biological strategies and a novel and new generation of feed additives need to be developed to replace feed antibiotic growth promoters and to directly and effectively detoxify the endotoxin LPS and improve gut health and performance in monogastric food animals.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the effects of feed restriction and source of dietary fatty acids during the close-up dry period on postcalving reproductive performance of dairy cattle. Thirty-four days before expected calving, pregnant Holstein cows (n = 72; parity 1 to 5) were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatments. Treatments were ad libitum (AL) or 24{\%} feed restriction (FR) in combination with 1 of 3 oilseed supplements at 8{\%} of diet dry matter: canola, linola, or flax to enrich the rations with oleic, linoleic, or linolenic fatty acids, respectively. After calving, cows were fed a common lactation diet that contained no oilseeds. Measurements of uterus, corpus luteum, and follicles were obtained by ultrasonography twice weekly from 7 1 d after calving until the first ovulation. Cows (n = 66) were subjected to timed artificial insemination (TAI), and pregnancy was determined 32 d later. Feed-restricted cows had lower dry matter intake and lost more body weight prepartum. Energy balance (Mcal/d) was negative in FR cows prepartum but they had a less severe negative energy balance postpartum. The dietary source of fatty acid did not affect energy balance. Cows fed AL had a higher incidence of uterine infections (10/37 vs. 2/35) but tended to have fewer ovarian cysts (2/37 vs. 7/35) than FR cows. Mean (+/-SE) interval from calving to uterine involution did not differ among dietary treatments (26.8 1.8 d). Interval from calving to first ovulation was longer in cows fed canola than in those fed either linola or flax (34.7 3.1 vs. 23.7 3.2 and 21.0 3.1 d, respectively). A greater percentage of cows fed AL conceived to the first TAI (47.1 vs. 18.8) and tended to have fewer mean days open (157 10.8 vs. 191 10.1) than cows fed FR. In summary, FR cows had a lower incidence of uterine infections, but they were less fertile as reflected by a lower percent pregnancy to first TAI and increased days open. Cows fed diets enriched in linoleic or linolenic fatty acids had a lesser incidence of ovarian cysts and ovulated sooner with no effect on energy balance or fertility.},

abstract = {Diets based on red clover silage (RCS) typically increase the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in ruminant meat and milk and lower the efficiency of N utilization compared with grass silages (GS). Four multiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows (108 d postpartum) fitted with rumen cannulas were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods to evaluate the effect of incremental replacement of GS with RCS on milk production, nutrient digestion, whole-body N metabolism, and milk fatty acid composition. Treatments comprised total mixed rations offered ad libitum, containing 600 g of forage/kg of diet dry matter (DM), with RCS replacing GS in ratios of 0:100, 33:67, 67:33, and 100:0 on a DM basis. Intake of DM and milk yield tended to be higher when RCS and GS were offered as a mixture than when fed alone. Forage species had no influence on the concentration or secretion of total milk fat, whereas replacing GS with RCS tended to decrease milk protein concentration and yield. Substitution of GS with RCS decreased linearly whole-tract apparent organic matter, fiber, and N digestion. Forage species had no effect on total nonammonia N at the omasum, whereas the flow of most AA at the omasum was higher for diets based on a mixture of forages. Replacing GS with RCS progressively lowered protein degradation in the rumen, increased linearly ruminal escape of dietary protein, and decreased linearly microbial protein synthesis. Incremental inclusion of RCS in the diet tended to lower whole-body N balance, increased linearly the proportion of dietary N excreted in feces and urine, and decreased linearly the utilization of dietary N for milk protein synthesis. Furthermore, replacing GS with RCS decreased linearly milk fat 4:0 to 8:0, 14:0, and 16:0 concentrations and increased linearly 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 concentrations, in the absence of changes in cis-9 18:1, cis-9, trans-11 18:2, or total trans fatty acid concentration. Inclusion of RCS in the diet progressively increased the apparent transfer of 18-carbon PUFA from the diet into milk, but had no effect on the amount of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 at the omasum recovered in milk. In conclusion, forage species modified ruminal N metabolism, the flow of AA at the omasum, and whole-body N partitioning. A lower efficiency of N utilization for milk protein synthesis with RCS relative to GS was associated with decreased availability of AA for absorption, with some evidence of an imbalance in the supply of AA relative to requirements. Higher enrichment of PUFA in milk for diets based on RCS was related to an increased supply for absorption, with no indication that forage species substantially altered PUFA bioavailability.},

Forty multiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated 5 x 5 Latin square design with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of equimolar treatments for cations (sodium and potassium), anions (chloride and bicarbonate), plus a control diet. Periods were 14 d in length with the last 4 d for data and sample collection. Diets were formulated to 29{\%} neutral detergent figer and 17.5{\%} crude protein. Sodium bicarbonate was included at 1{\%} of dry matter in one treatment diet, and other treatments (sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and potassium bicarbonate) were added to be equimolar to sodium bicarbonate in their respective diets. Chewing activity was recorded every 5 min for the last 24 h of each period. Dry matter intake was not affected by treatment (mean = 27.9 kg/d). Bicarbonate treatments increased yields of milk, milk fat, and fat- and solids-corrected milk compared with chloride treatments, but cation treatments did not affect any measured variable. The 4 ion treatments reduced ruminating time per day when compared with control by decreasing the length of rumination bouts. This effect was not specific to cations or anions suggesting a mechanism related to increased ruminal osmolality.},

A control diet with no supplemental fat and diets containing either hydrogenated tallow fatty acids or triglycerides at 2 and 5{\%} levels were fed for ad libitum intake. Diets were isonitrogenous but not isocaloric. Each treatment period consisted of 28 d; the last 14 d were used for data collection. Fat-supplemented diets had no effects on DM intake, milk fat percentage, milk protein percentage, and BW compared with the control diet. Energy intake and milk yields were higher for cows fed fat-supplemented diets. Adding fatty acids to diets increased milk fat percentage above that in milk from cows fed triglyceride diets. Apparent digestibilities of DM and OM were lowered by the addition of fat, mainly in response to fatty acid additions. Feeding fatty acids reduced ash digestibility compared with feeding triglycerides, and NDF digestibility also tended to be lower for cows fed fatty acid diets. Fat addition to diets reduced fatty acid digestibility; digestibility of added fat averaged 37.7{\%}. Although of similar saturation, the triglyceride supplement was more ruminally inert than the fatty acid supplement. Esterification and degree of saturation are features of importance when processing tallow for use in ruminant diets.},

The models included a new "log-quadratic" model, and a major objective was to evaluate and compare the performance of this model with the other models. Nine empirical and 5 mechanistic models were first fitted to average test-day milk yield of Holstein-Friesian dairy cows using the nonlinear procedure in SAS. Two additional semiparametric models were fitted using a linear model in ASReml. To investigate the influence of days to first test-day and the number of test-days, 5 of the best-fitting models were then fitted to individual cow lactation data. Model goodness of fit was evaluated using criteria such as the residual mean square, the distribution of residuals, the correlation between actual and predicted values, and the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test. Goodness of fit was similar in all but one of the models in terms of fitting average lactation but they differed in their ability to predict individual lactations. In particular, the widely used incomplete gamma model most displayed this failing. The new log-quadratic model was robust in fitting average and individual lactations, and was less affected by sampled data and more parsimonious in having only 3 parameters, each of which lends itself to biological interpretation.},

abstract = {Passive transfer of colostral immunoglobulins has long been accepted as imperative to optimal calf health. Many factors, including timing of colostrum ingestion, the method and volume of colostrum administration, the immunoglobulin concentration of the colostrum ingested, and the age of the dam have been implicated in affecting the optimization of absorption. The practice of colostrum pooling, the breed and presence of the dam, and the presence of respiratory acidosis in the calf also may affect passive transfer. Various tests have been reported to accurately measure passive transfer status in neonatal calves. The radial immunodiffusion and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are the only tests that directly measure serum IgG concentration. All other available tests including serum total solids by refractometry, sodium sulfite turbidity test, zinc sulfate turbidity test, serum gamma-glutamyl transferase activity, and whole blood glutaraldehyde gelation estimate serum IgG concentration based on concentration of total globulins or other proteins whose passive transfer is statistically associated with that of IgG. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature of passive transfer in calves including factors that affect passive transfer status, testing modalities, effects of failure of passive transfer on baseline mortality, consequences of failure of passive transfer, and some treatment options. Many previously accepted truisms regarding passive transfer in calves should be rejected based on the results of recent research.},

Forty-nine Holstein heifer calves (2±1 d of age) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: individually housed (G1; n=22) or group housed [3 calves per pen (G3); n=27]. The space allowances per calf were 4.8 and 7.0m(2) for G1 and G3, respectively. All calves were offered an identical plane of milk replacer nutrition (747 and 1,010g of DM/d of a 28{\%} CP:20{\%} fat milk replacer from wk 1 to 2 and wk 3 to 6, respectively). Weaning was initiated during wk 7 by removing the p.m. feeding and calves were completely weaned when they consumed 900g of calf starter/d (as fed) for 2 consecutive days after d 54. At d 90, calves were commingled into random outdoor groups of 5 calves per pen. Peripheral blood was collected during the neonatal (d 3, 10, and 21), weaning (d 46, 48, and 54), and commingling periods (d 90, 93, and 98) and was analyzed for neutrophil oxidative burst (OB) capacity when cocultured with Escherichia coli, neutrophil surface L-selectin protein expression, and whole-blood secretion of tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ when cocultured with lipopolysaccharide. Starter intake was greater for G3 during the postweaning period (wk 8 to 12). Average daily gain was greater for G3 than G1 from d 54 to 68 and tended to be greater after commingling from d 113 to 133. During the neonatal period, G3 calves had more activated neutrophils, as evidenced by increased neutrophil L-selectin protein expression and a tendency for increased percentage of neutrophils producing an OB than G1 calves. During weaning, G3 calves continued to have more activated neutrophils with increased L-selectin expression on d 46 and 48 and a greater OB intensity throughout the period. No differences were observed among leukocyte responses between treatments at d 93 and 98. Outdoor group-housed Holstein calves had improved performance and heightened neutrophil responses compared with individually housed calves.},

Percentages of fat, CP, and SNF in milk and total tract apparent digestibilities of DM, OM, ADF, NDF, energy, and fatty acids were not affected significantly by treatments. Infusing fatty acids decreased proportions and yields of short- and medium-chain fatty acids and increased proportions and yields of unsaturated C18 fatty acids in milk fat. Increasing unsaturation and chain length of infused fatty acids linearly decreased proportion and yield of palmitic acid but increased proportions and yields of polyunsaturated C18 fatty acids in milk fat.

abstract = {We evaluated the effects of varying the ratio of dietary palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), and oleic ( cis -9 C18:1) acids in diets with or without whole cottonseed on nutrient digestibility and production response of dairy cows. Twenty- four mid-lactation Holstein cows were used in split plot Latin square design. Cows were allocated to a main plot receiving either a basal diet without whole cottonseed (SH, n = 12) or a basal diet with whole cottonseed (CS, n = 12; 8{\%} diet DM). Within each plot a 4 × 4 Latin square arrangement of treat - ments was used in four consecutive 21-d periods. Fatty acid (FA) treatments were: 1) Control (CON; no supplemental fat); 2) C16:0 supplement (PA; {\~{}}80{\%} C16:0); 3) C16:0 and C18:0 supplement (PA+SA; {\~{}}40{\%} C16:0 + {\~{}}40{\%} C18:0); and 4) C16:0 and cis -9 C18:1 supplement (PA+OA; {\~{}}45{\%} C16:0 + {\~{}}35{\%} cis - C:) The final  d of each period were used for sample and data collection. The statistical model included the random effect of cow and the fixed effects of basal diet, FA treatment, period, and their interactions. Compared with SH diets, CS diets increased milk fat yield (1.71 vs. 1.51 kg/d; P = 0.05), yield of preformed milk FA (623 vs. 507 g/d; P {\textless} 0.01), and BW gain (1.0 vs. 0.71 kg/d; P = 0.04), tended to increase yield of de novo milk FA (396 vs. 383 g/d; P = 0.06), but re - duced NDF digestibility (41.9 vs. 46.4{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01) and total FA digestibility (74.2 vs. 76.3{\%} P = 0.05). Compared with other treatments, PA increased yield of milk fat (1.60, 1.70, 1.64 and 1.64 kg/d; P {\textless} 0.05) and 3.5{\%} FCM (45.2, 47.8, 46.8 and 46.5 kg/d; P {\textless} 0.01) for CON, PA, PA+SA and PA+OA, respectively. PA+OA increased BW gain compared with other treatments (0.82, 0.84, 0.70 and 1.05 kg/d; P {\textless} 0.05) for CON, PA, PA+SA and PA+OA, respectively. PA and PA+OA tended to increase NDF digestibility compared with PA+SA and CON (43.2, 44.9, 43.1 and 44.5{\%}; P {\textless} 0.10) for CON, PA, PA+SA and PA+OA, respectively. Compared with the other treatments, PA+SA reduced 16-carbon (77.6, 73.0, 66.0 and 79.1{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01), 18-carbon (79.2, 79.5, 72.0 and 79.7{\%}{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01), and total FA digestibility (78.6, 77.4, 68.2 and 79.4{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01) for CON, PA, PA+SA and PA+OA, respectively. In conclusion, diet inclusion of C16:0 increased energy out - put in milk, while inclusion cis -9 C18:1 increased BW gain. The combination of C16:0 and C18:0 reduced NDF and FA digestibilities, which likely explains its reduced performance compared with other treatments},

abstract = {This project aimed to determine effects of applying an inoculant containing homofermentative and heterofermentative bacteria on the fermentation, nutritive value, aerobic stability, and nutrient losses from corn silage produced in farm-scale silos. Corn forage was harvested at 34{\%} dry matter (DM) and treated without (control) or with 5 × 10⁵ cfu/g of Lactobacillus buchneri and Pediococcus pentosaceus. The inoculant was sprayed on alternate 8-row-wide swaths of forage, and the untreated and inoculated forages were alternately packed into 3.6-m-wide bag silos. Forty-five tonnes of corn forage were packed into each of 4 replicate bags per treatment and ensiled for 166 d. Silage removed from the bags (500 kg/d) was separated into good and spoiled (visibly moldy or darker) silage portions, and weighed for 35 d. Weekly composites were analyzed for chemical composition, aerobic stability, and fungal counts. Aerobic stability was measured using data loggers that recorded sample and ambient temperature every 30 min for 7 d. Inoculation did not affect the chemical composition of the spoiled or good silage but decreased the quantity (5.7 vs. 12.9 kg/d) and percentage (3.4 vs. 7.8) of spoiled silage in the bags by over 50{\%}. Losses of crude protein (0.28 vs. 0.92 kg/d), gross energy (6.0 × 10⁴ vs. 1.8 × 10⁵ kJ/d), and neutral detergent fiber (1.34 vs. 4.12 kg/d) in spoiled silage were less in inoculated versus control silages. Inoculated silages had lower pH (3.91 vs. 3.99), lactate concentration (7.63 vs. 7.86{\%}), lactate:acetate ratio (1.58 vs. 2.53{\%}), and a greater acetate (5.11 vs. 3.56{\%}) concentration than the control silage. Inoculated silages tended to have fewer yeasts (2.59 vs. 4.62 log cfu/g) than control silages, but aerobic stability was not different across treatments (14.7 vs. 9.5 h). Applying the inoculant made the fermentation more heterolactic, inhibited the growth of yeasts, and substantially reduced the amount of spoilage and the associated energy and nutrient losses.},

abstract = {Different protein sources, such as canola meal (CM) or dried distillers grains (DDG), are currently used in dairy rations to replace soybean meal (SBM). However, little data exists comparing their rumen degradation in a single study. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the ruminal degradation of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and AA of SBM, CM, high-protein corn DDG (HPDDG), and wheat DDG plus solubles (WDDGS). In situ studies were conducted with 4 rumen-fistulated lactating Holstein cows fed a diet containing 38{\%} grass hay and 62{\%} corn-based concentrate. Each protein source was incubated in the rumen of each cow in nylon bags for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48h to determine DM and CP rumen degradation kinetics, whereas additional bags were also incubated for 16h to evaluate AA ruminal disappearance. Rumen DM and CP degradability was calculated from rumen-undegraded residues corrected or not for small particle loss. Data were fitted to an exponential model to estimate degradation parameters and effective degradability (ED) was calculated with a passage rate of 0.074h(-1). The WDDGS and SBM had higher uncorrected ED (DM=75.0 and 72.6{\%}; CP=84.8 and 66.0{\%}, respectively) than CM and HPDDG (DM=57.2 and 55.5{\%}; CP=59.3 and 48.2{\%}, respectively), due to higher soluble fraction in WDDGS and a combination of higher potentially degradable fraction and rate of degradation in SBM. Correction for small particle loss from bags, higher for WDDGS than for the other protein sources, decreased estimated ED but did not alter feed ranking. The ruminal disappearance of AA after 16h of incubation reflected the overall pattern of CP degradation between protein supplements, but the ruminal disappearance of individual AA differed between protein supplements. Overall, these results indicate that, in the current study, (1) SBM and WDDGS were more degradable in the rumen than CM and HPDDG, and (2) that small particle loss correction is relevant but does not alter this ranking.},

abstract = {Sixteen (8 ruminally cannulated) multiparous and 8 primiparous lactating Holstein cows were used in 6 replicated 4 x 4 Latin squares to test the effects of feeding supplemental protein as urea, solvent soybean meal (SSBM), cottonseed meal (CSM), or canola meal (CM) on milk production, nutrient utilization, and ruminal metabolism. All diets contained ({\%} of DM) 21{\%} alfalfa silage and 35{\%} corn silage plus 1) 2{\%} urea plus 41{\%} high-moisture shelled corn (HMSC), 2) 12{\%} SSBM plus 31{\%} HMSC, 3) 14{\%} CSM plus 29{\%} HMSC, or 4) 16{\%} CM plus 27{\%} HMSC. Crude protein was equal across diets, averaging 16.6{\%}. Intake and production were substantially reduced, and milk urea, blood urea, and ruminal ammonia were increased on urea vs. the diets supplemented with true protein. Although intake was lower in cows fed SSBM compared with CM, no differences were observed for milk yield among SSBM, CSM, and CM. Yields of fat and protein both were lower on CSM than on CM, whereas SSBM was intermediate. Milk urea and milk protein contents also decreased when CSM replaced SSBM or CM. Diet did not affect ruminal volatile fatty acids except that isobutyrate concentration was lowest on urea, intermediate on CSM, and greatest on SSBM and CM. Urinary excretion of urea N and total N was greatest on urea, intermediate on SSBM and CM, and lowest on CSM. Apparent N efficiency (milk N/N intake) was lower on the CSM diet than on the SSBM diet. Overall, production and N utilization were compromised when the diets of high-yielding dairy cows were supplemented with urea rather than true protein and the value of the true proteins.},

abstract = {PROBLEM: In cattle, retained placenta (RP) is suggested to arise from failure of immune-mediated rejection of the fetal membranes by the maternal immune system and is associated with major histocompatibility (MHC) class I compatibility between calf and dam. METHOD OF STUDY: To study the association between RP and different MHC class I compatibilities between calf-dam-granddam combinations, massively parallel pyrosequencing was used to determine the MHC class I haplotypes of cows with and without RP. RESULTS: Two-way calf to dam MHC class I compatibility gave a high risk for RP. There was a tendency for a higher risk for RP with calf to dam MHC class I compatibility. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that in two-way compatible pregnancies, the maternal immune system fails to reject the fetal membranes, and the fetal immune system does not mount an immune response against maternal MHC class I antigens that could influence the immune-mediated rejection of the fetal membranes by the maternal immune system. The lack of immune-mediated rejection of the fetal membranes by the maternal immune system increases the risk of occurrence of RP.},

abstract = {In 2001, the 7th Revised Edition of the Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle was published (NRC, 2001). A major goal of the subcommittee was to make the energy system used in the new NRC (2001) balanced, i.e., energy supply should equal energy output. Reviews of the 1989 NRC (NRC, 1989) system found that energy intake (concentration of energy in feed times dry matter intake) was 5 to 7{\%} greater than energy expenditures (Vermorel and Coulon, 1998; Weiss, 1998). Because both papers suggested the error was more likely related to energy supply than energy requirements, the NRC (2001) completely changed the approach used to obtain feed energy values. The 2001 NRC also includes updated equations to estimate energy requirements of dairy cattle. This paper will provide an overview of the new NRC energy system and will discuss how these changes might affect diet formulation strategies and diet evaluation. The necessary equations can be found in NRC (2001) and will not be discussed in detail in this paper. Changes were made for all classes of dairy cattle (calves, growing heifers, lactating and dry cows), however, this paper will emphasize lactating cows.},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were 1) to examine the interactive influence of a compensatory nutrition regimen and lasalocid supplementation on dairy heifer growth performance and 2) to document the extent to which compensatory growth sustains lactation potential over the first two lactation cycles. Twelve Holstein heifers, weighing an average of 160 kg (about 6 mo of age) were randomly assigned to treatments arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Treatment variables were two dietary regimens (control and stair-step compensatory nutrition) and two levels of lasalocid (0 and 200 mg/d). The control heifers were fed a diet containing 12{\%} crude protein (CP) and 2.35 Mcal of metabolizable energy (ME) per kilogram of dry matter. The stair-step compensatory nutrition heifers were subjected to a phased nutrition regimen and reared according to an alternating 3-2-4-3-4-2-mo schedule. The first stair-step (prepubertal phase) consisted of energy restriction [17{\%} CP and 2.35 Mcal/kg of ME] for 3 mo followed by realimentation (12{\%} CP and 3.05 Mcal/kg of ME) for 2 mo. The second step (puberty and breeding) consisted of energy restriction for 4 mo followed by realimentation for 3 mo. The third step (gestation period) was energy restriction for 4 mo concluding with realimentation for 2 mo. Dry matter intake of heifers during the restriction phase was limited to 70{\%} of the control intake. Heifers were given ad libitum access to a high energy density diet during realimentation to allow compensatory development. Stair-step heifers supplemented with lasalocid had the highest efficiency of growth (body weight gain/dry matter intake), suggesting synergistic metabolism of lasalocid with compensatory growth action. Compensatory growth induced during the last trimester enhanced metabolic status by increasing circulating insulin and decreasing triglyceride levels. Heifers on the stair-step regimen had a significant increase in milk yield during the first (21{\%}) and second (15{\%}) lactation cycles. These results support our thesis that compensatory growth induced during an allometric growth phase improves mammary development and energy and protein metabolic status of dairy heifers.},

abstract = {Improved representation of postabsorptive N metabolism in lactating dairy cows requires a better understanding of protein synthesis regulation in the mammary glands. This study aimed to determine the quantitative effects of Ile, Leu, Met, and Thr on the phosphorylation state of signaling proteins that regulate protein synthesis. The experiment used a composite design with a central point, 2 axial points per AA, and a complete 2(4) factorial. All of the other AA were provided at the concentrations in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The experiment was replicated with tissues from 5 lactating cows. Mammary tissue slices (0.12±0.02g) were incubated for 4h. Total and site-specific phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; Ser2448), eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF) 2 (Thr56), ribosomal protein S6 (Ser235/236), and eukaryotic initiation factor 2$\alpha$ (Ser51) were determined by western immunoblotting. Tissue concentrations of the 4 AA studied responded linearly to media supply. Addition of Ile, Leu, Met, or Thr had no effect on eukaryotic initiation factor 2$\alpha$ phosphorylation. Isoleucine and Thr positively affected mTOR phosphorylation. However, the 2 AA had an antagonistic relationship. Similarly, Ile linearly increased ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation, and Thr inhibited the Ile effect. In addition, eEF2 phosphorylation was linearly decreased by Ile and Leu. Threonine curvilinearly decreased eEF2 phosphorylation, Ile and Leu negatively interacted on eEF2, and Thr tended to inhibit Leu effects on eEF2. This work demonstrated saturable responses and interactions between AA on activation of the mTOR pathway. Incorporation of these concepts into milk protein response models will help to improve milk and milk protein yield predictions and increase postabsorptive N efficiency and reduce N excretion by dairy cows.},

abstract = {Prepubertal mammary development can be affected by nutrition partly through alterations in gene network expression. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) remains the most accurate method to measure mRNA expression but is subject to analytical errors that introduce variation. Thus, qPCR data normalization through the use of internal control genes (ICG) is required. The objective of this study was to mine microarray data ({\textgreater} 10,000 genes) from prepubertal mammary parenchyma and stroma to identify the most suitable ICG for normalization of qPCR. Tissue for RNA extraction was obtained from calves ( approximately 63 d old; n = 5/diet) fed a control (200 g/kg crude protein, 210 g/kg crude fat, fed at 441 g/d dry matter) or a high-protein milk replacer (280 g/kg crude protein, 200 g/kg crude fat, fed at 951 g/d dry matter). ICG were selected based on both absence of expression variation across treatment and of coregulation (gene network analysis). Genes evaluated were ubiquitously expressed transcript, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 11 (PPP1R11), matrix metallopeptidase 14 (MMP14), ClpB caseinolytic peptidase B, SAPS domain family member 1 (SAPS1), mitochondrial GTPase 1 (MTG1), mitochondrial ribosomal protein L39, ribosomal protein S15a (RPS15A), and actin beta (ACTB). Network analysis demonstrated that MMP14 and ACTB are coregulated by v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene, tumor protein p53, and potentially insulin-like growth factor 1. Pairwise comparison of expression ratios showed that ACTB, MMP14, and SAPS1 had the lowest stability and were unsuitable as ICG. PPP1R11, RPS15A, and MTG1 were the most stable among ICG tested. We conclude that the geometric mean of PPP1R11, RPS15A, and MTG1 is ideal for normalization of qPCR data in prepubertal bovine mammary tissue. This study provides a list of candidate ICG that could be used by researchers working in bovine mammary development and allied fields.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to use meta-analytic methods to estimate the effect of a commercially available yeast culture product on milk production and other production measures in lactating dairy cows using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Sixty-one research publications (published journal articles, published abstracts, and technical reports) were identified through a review of literature provided by the manufacturer and a search of published literature using 6 search engines. Thirty-six separate studies with 69 comparisons met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The fixed-effect meta-analysis showed substantial heterogeneity for milk yield, energy-corrected milk, 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk, milk fat yield, and milk protein yield. Sub-group analysis of the data showed much less heterogeneity in peer-reviewed studies versus non-peer-reviewed abstracts and technical reports, and tended to show higher, but not significantly different, treatment effects. A random-effects meta-analysis showed estimated raw mean differences between treated and untreated cattle reported in peer-reviewed publications of 1.18kg/d [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.55 to 1.81], 1.61kg/d (95{\%} CI: 0.92 to 2.29), and 1.65kg/d (95{\%} CI: 0.97 to 2.34) for milk yield, 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk, respectively. Milk fat yield and milk protein yield for peer-reviewed studies showed an increase in the raw mean difference of 0.06kg/d (95{\%} CI: 0.01 to 0.10) and 0.03kg/d (95{\%} CI: 0.00 to 0.05), respectively. Estimated raw mean dry matter intake of the peer-reviewed studies during early lactation ({\textless}70 d in milk) and not-early lactation were 0.62kg/d (95{\%} CI: 0.21 to 1.02) and a decrease of 0.78kg/d (95{\%} CI: −1.36 to −0.21), respectively. These findings provide strong evidence that this commercially available yeast culture product provides significant improvement in several important milk production outcomes as evaluated in production settings typical for commercial dairies in North America. Utilizing meta-analytic methods to study the complete breadth of information relating to a specific treatment by studying multiple overcomes of all eligible studies can reduce the uncertainty often seen in small individual studies designed without sufficient power to detect differences in treatments.},

Trial 1 was a replicated 5 x 5 Latin square that used 2-wk periods and 25 Holstein cows (five with ruminal cannulae) fed diets containing [dry matter (DM) basis] 28{\%} alfalfa silage, 31{\%} corn silage, 28{\%} high moisture ear corn plus 4 percentage units of crude protein (CP) from: soybean meal, urea, commercial fermentation byproduct 1 or 2, or a blend of fermentation byproducts plus wheat middlings. Diets averaged 15.1{\%} CP and 32{\%} neutral detergent fiber. Intake of DM, body weight (BW) gain, and yield of milk and milk components were greatest for cows fed soybean meal; animal performance was similar with urea, byproduct 1 and the byproduct blend. Intake, BW change, and yield of milk and protein when cows were fed byproduct 2 were lower than when fed urea. Urine output (estimated with creatinine in spot urine samples) was greater on fermentation byproduct 1 and the byproduct blend. There were no differences due to N source in microbial synthesis (based on estimated purine derivative excretion), in situ digestion of alfalfa hay DM, or molar proportions of ruminal volatile fatty acids. Trial 2 was a replicated 5 x 5 Latin square using 2-wk periods and 10 Holstein cows fed diets containing (DM basis) 37{\%} alfalfa silage, 28{\%} corn silage, 29{\%} high moisture ear corn plus 2 percentage units of CP from urea, fermentation byproduct 1, or one of three blends of fermentation byproducts plus wheat middlings. Except for greater DM intake in cows fed the byproduct blends, performance and urinary metabolite excretion did not differ because of N supplement. Relative to other fermentation byproducts and urea, byproduct 1 resulted in reduced milk urea N in both trials. Under the conditions of these trials, fermentation byproducts were less effective than soybean meal, and no more effective than urea, as N supplements.},

diet type (total mixed ration- vs. pasture-based

diet) on concentrations of individual fatty acids

was examined. {\{}P{\}}airwise correlations for

concentrations (g/kg) of individual fatty acids in

milk showed that almost all of the individual de

unsaturated preformed fatty acids were generally

positively correlated with each other but were

negatively correlated with concentrations of total

de novo fatty acids. {\{}S{\}}ubstantial variation was found

in the concentrations of individual milk fatty acids

and, apart from those synthesized de novo,

concentrations of individual fatty acids did not

vary in concert. {\{}T{\}}he adequacy of literature data for

the development of a model to predict the production

of the major individual fatty acids in milk is

discussed. {\{}T{\}}he limitations associated with the

currently available studies that may be used in a

predictive model are 1) failure of many publications

to adequately describe dietary details, 2) reporting

poorly defined milk fatty acids, 3) aggregating a

number of closely related fatty acids under a single

category, and 4) the selective reporting of only

those fatty acids that are present in milk fat in

appreciable quantities. {\{}D{\}}espite these limitations,

the data are sufficient to enable development of a

model to predict the concentrations and production

extreme variability in concentrations of individual

abstract = {Design III is an experimental design originally proposed by R.E. COMSTOCK and H.F. ROBINSON for estimating genetic variances and the average degree of dominance for quantitative trait loci (QTL) and has recently been extended for mapping QTL. In this paper, we first extend COMSTOCK and ROBINSON's analysis of variance to include linkage, two-locus epistasis and the use of F3 parents. Then we develop the theory and statistical analysis of orthogonal contrasts and contrast x environment interaction for a single marker locus to characterize the effects of QTL. The methods are applied to the maize data of C.W. STUBER. The analyses strongly suggest that there are multiple linked QTL in many chromosomes for several traits examined. QTL effects are largely environment-independent for grain yield, ear height, plant height and ear leaf area and largely environment dependent for days to tassel, grain moisture and ear number. There is significant QTL epistasis. The results are generally in favor of the hypothesis of dominance of favorable genes to explain the observed heterosis in grain yield and other traits, although epistasis could also play an important role and overdominance at individual QTL level can not be ruled out.},

abstract = {Genome-wide genetic evaluation might involve the
computation of BLUP-like estimations, potentially
including thousands of covariates (i.e.,
single-nucleotide polymorphism markers) for each
record. This implies dense Henderson's mixed-model
equations and considerable computing resources in
time and storage, even for a few thousand
records. Possible computing options include the type
of storage and the solving algorithm. This work
evaluated several computing options, including
half-stored Cholesky decomposition, Gauss-Seidel,
and 3 matrix-free strategies: Gauss-Seidel,
Gauss-Seidel with residuals update, and
preconditioned conjugate gradients. Matrix-free
Gauss-Seidel with residuals update adjusts the
residuals after computing the solution for each
effect. This avoids adjusting the left-hand side of
the equations by all other effects at every step of
the algorithm and saves considerable computing
time. Any Gauss-Seidel algorithm can easily be
extended for variance component estimation by Markov
chain-Monte Carlo. Let m and n be the number of
records and markers, respectively. Computing time
for Cholesky decomposition is proportional to
n3. Computing times per round are proportional to
mn2 in matrix-free Gauss-Seidel, to n2 for
half-stored Gauss-Seidel, and to n and m for the
rest of the algorithms. Algorithms were tested on a
real mouse data set, which included 1,928 records
and 10,946 single-nucleotide polymorphism
markers. Computing times were in the order of a few
minutes for Gauss-Seidel with residuals update and
preconditioned conjugate gradients, more than 1 h
for half-stored Gauss-Seidel, 2 h for Cholesky
decomposition, and 4 d for matrix-free
Gauss-Seidel. Preconditioned conjugate gradients was
the fastest. Gauss-Seidel with residuals update
would be the method of choice for variance component
estimation as well as solving. },

Diets were fed for 1-wk periods to eight nonlactating Holsteins assigned to two replicated 4 x 4 Latin squares. Daily DMI increased as time of access to the diet increased up to d 5; mean DMI over d 5 to 7 was reduced by dietary anionic salts. Diets containing anionic salts induced a mild metabolic acidosis that was completely compensated by nonrespiratory mechanisms (decreased blood bicarbonate and base excess; pCO2 and pH values were unaffected). Urinary pH values and bicarbonate excretion were reduced, and urinary NH4+ and titratable acidity excretion were increased, for cows fed diets containing anionic salts. Strong ion difference in urine was decreased by dietary anionic salts because of the relatively greater excretions of Cl- and S2- versus Na+ and K+ by cows fed these diets. Dietary anionic salts decreased mean ruminal pH by 0.12 units, possibly because of the reduced strong ion difference of ruminal fluid. Dietary anionic salts increased mean ruminal NH3 concentration by 2.2 mM, probably because of the higher nonprotein N content of these diets. The strong negative relationship (r2 = 0.95) between urinary pH and net acid excretion by cows fed the diets containing anionic salts suggested that urinary pH measurement might be a useful tool to assess the degree of metabolic acidosis that was imposed by dietary anionic salts.},

Dietary crude protein as a percent of dry matter ranged from 9.5 to 20.2{\%} and was varied with soybean meal. Exponential models were developed to predict changes in milk yield and dry matter intake per unit change in dietary crude protein. The consequence of changes in concentration of dietary crude protein on performance can be predicted with the models. The dose-response relationships can be used with relevant price information to estimate the concentration of crude protein that maximizes returns over feed costs. Profitability is improved by adjusting concentration of dietary crude protein for changes in the price of soybean meal. Present feeding standards could be enhanced by incorporation of information on dose-response and economics.},

abstract = {Microbial fermentation of carbohydrates in the hindgut of dairy cattle is responsible for 5 to 10{\%} of total-tract carbohydrate digestion. When dietary, animal, or environmental factors contribute to abnormal, excessive flow of fermentable carbohydrates from the small intestine, hindgut acidosis can occur. Hindgut acidosis is characterized by increased rates of production of short-chain fatty acids including lactic acid, decreased digesta pH, and damage to gut epithelium as evidenced by the appearance of mucin casts in feces. Hindgut acidosis is more likely to occur in high-producing animals fed diets with relatively greater proportions of grains and lesser proportions of forage. In these animals, ruminal acidosis and poor selective retention of fermentable carbohydrates by the rumen will increase carbohydrate flow to the hindgut. In more severe situations, hindgut acidosis is characterized by an inflammatory response; the resulting breach of the barrier between animal and digesta may contribute to laminitis and other disorders. In a research setting, effects of increased hindgut fermentation have been evaluated using pulse-dose or continuous abomasal infusions of varying amounts of fermentable carbohydrates. Continuous small-dose abomasal infusions of 1 kg/d of pectin or fructans into lactating cows resulted in decreased diet digestibility and decreased milk fat percentage without affecting fecal pH or VFA concentrations. The decreased diet digestibility likely resulted from increased bulk in the digestive tract or from increased digesta passage rate, reducing exposure of the digesta to intestinal enzymes and epithelial absorptive surfaces. The same mechanism is proposed to explain the decreased milk fat percentage because only milk concentrations of long-chain fatty acids were decreased. Pulse-dose abomasal fructan infusions (1 g/kg of BW) into steers resulted in watery feces, decreased fecal pH, and increased fecal VFA concentrations, without causing an inflammatory response. Daily 12-h abomasal infusions of a large dose of starch ({\~{}}4 kg/d) have also induced hindgut acidosis as indicated by decreased fecal pH and watery feces. On the farm, watery or foamy feces or presence of mucin casts in feces may indicate hindgut acidosis. In summary, hindgut acidosis occurs because of relatively high rates of large intestinal fermentation, likely due to digestive dysfunction in other parts of the gut. A better understanding of the relationship of this disorder to other animal health disorders is needed.},

abstract = {Premature mortality and culling causes great wastage in the dairy industry, as a large number of heifers born never become productive or are culled before their full lactation potential is reached. The objectives of this study were to characterize survival and estimate genetic parameters for alternative longevity traits that considered (1) the survival of replacement heifers and (2) functional longevity of milking cows in the UK Holstein Friesian population, using combined information from the British Cattle Movement Service and milk recording organizations. Mortality of heifers was highest in the first month of life and was proportionately highest in calves born during winter months. Heifer mortality tended to decrease with age until about 16 mo onward; it then gradually increased, expected to be associated with culls due to reproductive failure or problems during pregnancy and calving. In milking cows, days of productive life (DPL) was analyzed as an alternative to the current trait lifespan score. Cows that died in 2009 on average lived for 6.8 yr with an average production of 4.3 yr. Heritability estimates were low for both heifer and cow survival and were ∼0.01 and ∼0.06, respectively. The positive genetic correlation between heifer survival with lifespan score (0.31) indicates that bulls that sire daughters with longer productive lives are also likely to have calves that survive and become replacement heifers. However, the magnitude of the genetic correlation suggests that survival in the rearing period and the milking herd are different traits. Genetic correlations were favorable between DPL with somatic cell count and fertility traits indicating that animals with a longer productive life tend to have lower somatic cell count, a shorter calving interval, fewer days to first service, and require fewer inseminations. However, an antagonistic relationship existed between DPL with milk and fat yield traits.},

abstract = {The economic efficiency of dairy farms is the main goal of farmers. The objective of this work was to use routinely available information at the dairy farm level to develop an index of profitability to rank dairy farms and to assist the decision-making process of farmers to increase the economic efficiency of the entire system. A stochastic modeling approach was used to study the relationships between inputs and profitability (i.e., income over feed cost; IOFC) of dairy cattle farms. The IOFC was calculated as: milk revenue + value of male calves + culling revenue - herd feed costs. Two databases were created. The first one was a development database, which was created from technical and economic variables collected in 135 dairy farms. The second one was a synthetic database (sDB) created from 5,000 synthetic dairy farms using the Monte Carlo technique and based on the characteristics of the development database data. The sDB was used to develop a ranking index as follows: (1) principal component analysis (PCA), excluding IOFC, was used to identify principal components (sPC); and (2) coefficient estimates of a multiple regression of the IOFC on the sPC were obtained. Then, the eigenvectors of the sPC were used to compute the principal component values for the original 135 dairy farms that were used with the multiple regression coefficient estimates to predict IOFC (dRI; ranking index from development database). The dRI was used to rank the original 135 dairy farms. The PCA explained 77.6{\%} of the sDB variability and 4 sPC were selected. The sPC were associated with herd profile, milk quality and payment, poor management, and reproduction based on the significant variables of the sPC. The mean IOFC in the sDB was 0.1377 ± 0.0162 euros per liter of milk (€/L). The dRI explained 81{\%} of the variability of the IOFC calculated for the 135 original farms. When the number of farms below and above 1 standard deviation (SD) of the dRI were calculated, we found that 21 farms had dRI {\textless} -1 SD, 32 farms were between -1 SD and 0, 67 farms were between 0 and +1 SD, and 15 farms had dRI {\textgreater} +1 SD. The top 10{\%} of the farms had a dRI greater than 0.170 €/L, whereas the bottom 10{\%} farms had a dRI lower than 0.116 €/L. This stochastic approach allowed us to understand the relationships among the inputs of the studied dairy farms and to develop a ranking index for comparison purposes. The developed methodology may be improved by using more inputs at the dairy farm level and considering the actual cost to measure profitability.},

abstract = {Feeding silages with high concentrations of yeasts from aerobic spoilage is often implicated as a cause of poor animal performance on dairies. Our objective was to determine if a commonly found spoilage yeast, isolated from silage, had the potential to alter in vitro ruminal fermentations. A single colony of Issatchenkia orientalis, isolated from high-moisture corn, was grown in selective medium. The yeast culture was purified and added to in vitro culture tubes containing a total mixed ration (43{\%} concentrate, 43{\%} corn silage, 11{\%} alfalfa haylage, and 3{\%} alfalfa hay on a dry matter basis), buffer, and ruminal fluid to achieve added theoretical final concentrations of 0 (CTR), 4.40 (low yeast; LY), 6.40 (medium yeast; MY), and 8.40 (high yeast; HY) log10 cfu of yeast/mL of in vitro fluid. Seven separate tubes were prepared for each treatment and each time point and incubated for 12 and 24 h at 39°C. At the end of the incubation period, samples were analyzed for pH, yeast number, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility, volatile fatty acids (VFA), and fatty acids (FA). We found that total viable yeast counts decreased for all treatments in in vitro incubations but were still relatively high (5.3 log10 cfu of yeasts/mL) for HY after 24 h of incubation. Addition of HY resulted in a lower pH and higher concentration of total VFA in culture fluid compared with other treatments. Moreover, additions of MY and HY decreased in vitro NDF digestibility compared with CTR, and the effect was greatest for HY. Overall, the biohydrogenation of dietary unsaturated FA was not altered by addition of I. orientalis and decreased over time with an increase in the accumulation of saturated FA, especially palmitic and stearic acids. We conclude that addition of I. orientalis, especially at high levels, has the potential to reduce in vitro NDF digestion and alter other aspects of ruminal fermentations.},

abstract = {Holstein dairy cows (four J5 vaccinates and four controls) selected for no recorded intramammary disease and low somatic cell count (SCC) during the previous lactation were challenged by intramammary infusion of Escherichia coli. Vaccination with J5 was at 8 weeks and again 4 weeks before the anticipated calving date. Cows were challenged at 8 to 16 days in milk (DIM). Shedding of E. coli in milk was significantly higher among controls than vaccinates (no shedding) from 6 h to 21 h postchallenge. From 21 h to 132 h postchallenge, SCC in challenged quarters of controls (5,429,000/ml) was significantly higher than that of vaccinates (490,000/ml). On the day after challenge, milk production in control cows was 8 kg less, while vaccinates gained 0.5 kg, a significant difference. In serum immediately prior to challenge, J5-specific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) was significantly higher, IgG2 was nearly significantly higher, and IgM was the same in J5 vaccinates relative to controls. Vaccinates had proportionally more IgG2 in serum postcalving and in the first 12 h following challenge and less IgG2 in milk 24 h after challenge than the controls, approaching statistical significance. The ratio of J5-specific IgG1 and IgG2 combined compared to IgM was significantly higher in vaccinates than in controls in prechallenge serum (ratios of 15.8 and 3.2, respectively) and milk (5.0 and 1.3, respectively). Cows with higher IgM titers in milk 12 h postchallenge produced significantly less milk. Vaccination with J5 was significantly associated with higher production of J5-specific IgG1 and IgG2 in early lactation, reduced SCC, faster clearance of E. coli from milk, and less milk production loss following intramammary challenge.},

Eight (4 primiparous and 4 multiparous) ruminally and duodenally cannulated Holstein cows were assigned to 4 dietary treatments in a replicated 21-d period, 4 x 4 Latin square design with a 2 x 2 factorial treatment arrangement. Diets, fed as TMR, contained (DM basis) 2 levels of forage (35 and 60{\%}) and 2 levels of NFC (30 and 40{\%}). The forage portion of the diets contained 50{\%} corn silage, 33{\%} alfalfa hay, and 17{\%} grass hay. Soybean hulls and beet pulp (2:1) and corn meal and ground barley (2:1) were included to achieve desired NFC concentrations. No supplemental B-vitamins were fed. B-vitamin AS was calculated as the amount of a specific B-vitamin flowing to the duodenum minus its daily orts-corrected intake. Dry matter and organic matter intakes were higher for cows fed the 35{\%} forage diets and the 40{\%} NFC diets. Increasing dietary forage content decreased ruminal AS of pyridoxine, folic acid, and B12. Increasing dietary NFC content increased ruminal AS of nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, niacin, pyridoxal, B6, and folic acid but decreased AS of B12. Across diets, amounts of B-vitamins synthesized were highest for niacin, followed by riboflavin, B12, thiamin, B6, and folic acid. Biotin AS values were negative for all diets, suggesting either no ruminal synthesis or that destruction by ruminal microflora was greater than synthesis. B-vitamin intake, duodenal flow, and ruminal synthesis are influenced by dietary forage and NFC contents.},

abstract = {The structure, prediction steps, and accuracy of the US (NRC), United Kingdom (ARC), Dutch (VEM), French (UFL), and German (NEL) systems for feeding high producing cows were compared. Simulations were made using 15 feeds ranging from hays to cereals. Agreement was satisfactory among European systems for the prediction of metabolizable energy and net energy for lactation (NEL) contents of feeds and the quantities of feeds in balanced diets necessary to meet the energy requirements of lactating cows. The metabolizable energy and NEL contents of feeds seemed overestimated by the US system compared with results using the European systems, and the ratio of NEL to total digestible nutrients was almost constant, unlike the other systems. Estimating the NEL content of feeds for a level three times maintenance intake allowed satisfactory rationing for the production of 20 to 25 kg of fat-corrected milk/d. However, feed allowances seemed underestimated for higher milk production, especially with diets based on hay, probably because of the overestimation of feed NEL content, the underestimation of level of feeding, and the effects associated with feeding levels {\textgreater} 3 and high concentrate diets.},

abstract = {Eight multiparous, ruminally cannulated Holstein cows averaging 40 d in milk and 575 kg BW at the start of trial were in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square arrangement (28-d periods) to determine the effects of dietary nonfiber carbohydrate (NFC) level and Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract (AO) on intake, milk production, and nutrient digestibility. Treatments were 42 or 35{\%} NFC and 0 or 3 g of AO per day arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial. Diets formulated to contain 21{\%} NDF from alfalfa silage (48.4{\%} of ration DM) and 18.5{\%} CP were fed as total mixed rations twice daily. Alteration of dietary NFC level was by partial replacement of shelled corn and soybean meal with wheat middlings and brewers dried grains. Intake of NDF was higher (1.49 vs 1.22{\%} of BW) for 35 than for 42{\%} NFC diets, but DMI was lower (24.1 vs 24.9 kg/d). Milkfat percentage, ruminal pH, ammonia, acetate (moles/100 moles), and total tract digestibility of fiber were higher for 35{\%} NFC diets; however, ruminal disappearance of DM, CP, and NDF from Dacron bags containing alfalfa hay was not affected (P {\textgreater} .10) by NFC level. Supplementation with AO did not affect (P {\textgreater} .10) DMI, milk yield, or nutrient digestion. Partial replacement of corn with high-fiber byproducts to lower dietary NFC level and correspondingly increase NDF level increased NDF intake but effected only a small change in DMI. Reducing dietary NFC level improved ruminal fermentation and milkfat percentage without significantly affecting milk yield.},

abstract = {A longitudinal prospective intervention study investigated the effect of biotin supplementation on the incidence (new cases per day) of visible lameness in milking cows and heifers on five commercial farms in Gloucestershire, United Kingdom. The trial lasted from June 1997 to April 1999. Each farm participated in the trial for 18 mo. Within each herd the cows were randomly allocated to either receive a supplement of 20 mg of biotin per day or not. All cows were run as one herd on each farm. When a lame cow was identified, the farmer called one of six veterinarians to examine and treat the affected animal; findings were recorded on a standard form. A veterinarian also carried out a bimonthly locomotion assessment to ensure that all lame cows were diagnosed. There were a total of 900 cows, 1120 cow years, in the trial. The overall incidence rate of lameness (per 100 cows per year) was 68.9, with a range of 31.6 to 111.5 per farm. The incidence rates of the four most frequently reported causes of lameness were sole ulcer, 13.8; white line separation, 12.7; digital dermatitis, 12.0; and interdigital necrobacillosis, 7.1 per 100 cows per year. There was a significant difference in the incidence rate of these four lesions between supplemented and unsupplemented cows on two of the five farms, with a significant decrease in lameness in the cows supplemented with biotin. When all the farms were pooled, the risk of lameness caused by white line separation in cattle supplemented with biotin was approximately halved (Cox proportional hazard survival analysis hazard ratio = 0.57).},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to: 1) evaluate how stocking density at the feed bunk affects feeding and social behavior of dairy cows; and 2) determine if this effect is further influenced by the type of feed barrier used. Thirty-six lactating Holstein cows, allotted to 4 groups, were subjected to each of 4 stocking density treatments and 2 feed barrier treatments. Initially, 2 groups were assigned to a headlock barrier, and 2 groups to a post-and-rail barrier. Each group was then exposed to 4 stocking density treatments (0.81, 0.61, 0.41, and 0.21 m/cow, corresponding to 1.33, 1.00, 0.67, and 0.33 headlocks/cow), in 4 successive 10-d treatment periods. After these periods, the feed barriers were switched between groups and the 4 stocking density treatments were readministered. Time-lapse video was used to quantify feeding, standing, and aggressive behavior at the feed bunk. Daily feeding times were greater and duration of inactive standing in the feeding area was less when using a post-and-rail compared with a headlock feed barrier. Feeding time decreased and inactive standing increased for both barrier designs as stocking density increased at the feed bunk. Cows were displaced more often from the feeding area when the stocking density was increased, and this effect was greater for cows using the post-and-rail feed barrier. Cows ranked lower in the social hierarchy at the feed bunk were displaced more often when feeding at a post-and-rail barrier, particularly at high stocking densities. Therefore, we recommend avoiding overstocking at the feed bunk to increase feeding activity and reduce competition. Use of a barrier that provides some physical separation between adjacent cows, such as a headlock feed barrier, can be used to further reduce competition at the feed bunk.},

@article{Daetwyler2010,
abstract = {The rapid increase in high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism data has led to a great interest in applying genome-wide evaluation methods to identify an individual's genetic merit. Genome-wide evaluation combines statistical methods with genomic data to predict genetic values for complex traits. Considerable uncertainty currently exists in determining which genome-wide evaluation method is the most appropriate. We hypothesize that genome-wide methods deal differently with the genetic architecture of quantitative traits and genomes. A genomic linear method (GBLUP), and a genomic nonlinear Bayesian variable selection method (BayesB) are compared using stochastic simulation across three effective population sizes and a wide range of numbers of quantitative trait loci (N(QTL)). GBLUP had a constant accuracy, for a given heritability and sample size, regardless of N(QTL). BayesB had a higher accuracy than GBLUP when N(QTL) was low, but this advantage diminished as N(QTL) increased and when N(QTL) became large, GBLUP slightly outperformed BayesB. In addition, deterministic equations are extended to predict the accuracy of both methods and to estimate the number of independent chromosome segments (M(e)) and N(QTL). The predictions of accuracy and estimates of M(e) and N(QTL) were generally in good agreement with results from simulated data. We conclude that the relative accuracy of GBLUP and BayesB for a given number of records and heritability are highly dependent on M(e,) which is a property of the target genome, as well as the architecture of the trait (N(QTL)).},

abstract = {The objective of this experiment was to determine whether it is the return from milking or delivery of fresh feed that has the greater effect on the daily patterns of feeding and lying behavior of dairy cattle. Forty-eight lactating Holstein cows were subjected to each of 2 treatments in a 2 x 2 cross-over design replicated over time. The treatments were 1) milking and feed delivery times coinciding and 2) feed delivery 6 h after milking. Cows were milked twice daily at 0500 and 1700 h. An electronic monitoring system was used to measure the time spent at the feed alley. Time-lapse video was used to quantify the lying time and incidence of aggressive displacements of the cows at the feed alley. Cows increased their total daily feeding time by 12.5{\%} when fed 6 h after milking. This change was driven by an 82{\%} increase in feeding time during the first hour immediately following the delivery of fresh feed and a 26{\%} decrease in feeding time during the first hour after milking. The delivery of feed 6 h after milking did not change the daily lying time of the cows, but did decrease the latency to lie down after milking by 20 min. The reduction in feeding time after milking and decreased latency to lie down resulted in a tendency for less aggressive interactions at the feed alley after the cows returned from milking. These results indicate that the delivery of fresh feed has a greater impact on stimulating feeding behavior than does the return from milking and that changes in feeding management can affect both the feeding and lying behavior of dairy cows.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have investigated the effect of shortened dry periods on milk production in the subsequent lactation. What is lacking from these studies is an understanding of the effect that a shortened dry period has on udder health. Four herds, 156 cows, were studied to determine if a shortened dry period (30 d) had a negative effect on mammary gland health during the subsequent lactation as opposed to cows assigned to a long, 45 or 60 d, dry period. Cows in 2 herds were assigned to either 30- or 60-d dry periods (group I), whereas cows in the other 2 herds were assigned to either 30- or 45-d dry periods (group II). Intramammary instillation of commercial preparations of cephapirin benzathine, 300 mg (dry cow formulation), was given to cows assigned a 45- or 60-d dry period length protocol, and 200 mg (lactating cow formulation) was administered to cows assigned a 30-d dry period. Differences in response variables to dry period length were compared within group. Cure rates for 60- vs. 30-d dry period cows were 72{\%} (28/39) vs. 81{\%} (30/37) and 74{\%} (25/34) and 73{\%} (27/37) for 45- vs. 30-d dry periods. Differences were not statistically significant for either comparison group. The majority of intramammary infections were caused by the minor pathogens, coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 102) or Corynebacterium bovis (n = 11). Only 11 cows had intramammary infections by major pathogens. The herd average percentage of new intramammary infections ranged from 6 to 9{\%} and did not differ among herds between treatment groups. Linear somatic cell counts were not significantly affected by dry period length during the first 6 to 7 mo of the subsequent lactation. Milk production did differ between groups. Mature equivalent milk production was greater in group I cows given a 60-d dry period (11,942 +/- 2,059 kg) as opposed to those given a 30-d dry period (10,749 +/- 2,321 kg). Cows given a 45-d dry period did not produce more milk than cows with a 30-d dry period in group II. Although shortening the dry period to 30 d did not have untoward effects on mammary gland health as measured by intramammary infections or milk somatic cell counts, production may be adversely affected when dry periods are shortened to 30 d.},

From the digestibility in vivo by wethers or in vitro, the metabolizable energy in the ration was predicted as well as the net energy to be produced. In the latter, the net energy for maintenance was assumed to be 70 kcal/kg a/{\~{}} metabolic body weight. Prediction of energy in milk and energy balance agreed well with the results of energy balance trials with dairy cows fed on winter rations. For fresh grass a discrepancy was found which is not yet explainable, but further research on this subject is in progress. In the feeding trials, the measured average weight change agreed rather well with the predicted energy balance. Finally, the reliability of these methods for testing this new feed evaluation system is discussed.},

abstract = {Postmilking teat disinfection is an effective management practice to prevent transmission of contagious mastitis pathogens from cow to cow. With farms increasing in size and an increase in the number of rotary milking parlors, the need for automation of postmilking teat disinfection is mounting. Automated teat dipping and backflushing (ADB) systems have existed for some years, but their effect on udder health was never examined in a field study on commercial dairy farms. The objectives of this study were, therefore, to evaluate the effect of introducing an ADB system in a herd on (1) bulk milk somatic cell count (SCC), (2) individual cow SCC, and (3) the proportion of newly elevated SCC. Dairy herd improvement data were collected over a 30-mo period on 25 sets of 3 farms. Each set of 3 farms contained a farm that installed an ADB system, one that disinfected teats using dipping after milking, and one that sprayed teats after milking. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. Bulk milk SCC on farms that sprayed or dipped before installing an ADB system were 16,000 and 30,000 cells/mL lower in the period 6 to 18 mo after installation, respectively, than on farms that continued spraying or dipping the teats after milking. In the same period after installing an ADB system, proportions of cows with elevated SCC were 4.3 and 1.2{\%} lower, respectively, compared with spraying and with dipping. Similarly, proportions of cows that had newly elevated SCC were 1.5{\%} lower and 0.3{\%} higher, respectively, compared with farms that sprayed or dipped. Installing an ADB system had a beneficial effect on bulk milk SCC, individual cow SCC, and the proportion of newly elevated SCC. The effect was most prominent in the period 6 to 18 mo after installation of an ADB system.},

abstract = {Dietary calcined magnesite supplements of different particle sizes and temperatures of calcination were examined at Glasgow University Veterinary School in 1981. Balance experiments with wether sheep revealed that particle sizes {\textless} 75, 75-150, 150-250 and 500-1000 $\mu$m diameter of a feed-grade calcined magnesite all increased urinary output of magnesium to a similar extent but the apparent magnesium availability coefficient for the 500-1000 $\mu$m diameter fraction (0.03) was significantly less than for fractions of smaller diameter (0.17-0.23) (P {\textless} 0.01). A 1000-2000 $\mu$m fraction of fertilizer-grade material had an apparent availability of 0.18 but had the least effect on urinary magnesium output. Calcination temperatures of 800, 900 and 1100 °C significantly increased apparent availability (c. 0.46) compared with that for temperatures of 500 and 650 °C (c. 0.12) (P {\textless} 0.01), and significantly increased urinary output of magnesium. Losses of magnesium from these supplements incubated in the rumen of cows at grass in 24 $\mu$m mesh nylon bags showed some correlations with their apparent availability and urinary magnesium output. Solubility in molar ammonium nitrate showed some good correlations with urinary magnesium output but not with magnesium availability. Supplementation of a low magnesium diet given to lactating ewes with fine particle ( {\textless} 75$\mu$m) calcined magnesite resulted in significantly greater increases in plasma magnesium concentration than when coarse particle material (500-1000 $\mu$m) was given (P {\textless} 0.05), but magnesites calcined at 650 and 800 °C induced similar changes in plasma magnesium.},

abstract = {Fifteen primiparous crossbred dairy cows that were 114±14d in milk and weighed 533±56kg were used in a replicated 5×5 Latin square to test the efficacy of a calcium montmorillonite clay, NovaSil Plus (NSP; BASF Corp., Ludwigshaven, Germany), for the reduction of aflatoxin (AF) metabolite (AFM1) in milk and the effect of NSP on milk composition. Cows were housed in a freestall barn, fed once a day and milked twice a day. The experiment consisted of five 14-d periods: d 1 through 7 were considered for data collection, and d 8 through 14 were considered a wash-out phase. In each period, cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 dietary treatments: (1) control (CON), consisting of a basal total mixed ration (TMR); (2) high-dose NSP diet (NSP-1{\%}), consisting of TMR plus 230g of NSP; (3) aflatoxin diet (AFD), consisting of the TMR plus AF challenge; (4) low-dose NSP with AF (NSP-0.5{\%}+AFD), composed of TMR plus 115g of NSP and AF challenge; and (5) high-dose NSP with AF (NSP-1{\%}+AFD), consisting of TMR plus 230g of NSP and AF challenge. The AF challenge consisted of top dressing a daily dose of 100 µg/kg estimated dry matter intake (DMI); similarly, NSP was fed at 1.0 or 0.5{\%} of estimated DMI. Milk yield and DMI were similar across treatments averaging 21.1±1.33kg/d and 19.7±0.56kg/d, respectively. Concentration of milk fat, protein, and lactose were similar across treatments with averages of 4.91±0.20{\%}, 3.85±0.10{\%}, and 4.70±0.06{\%}, respectively. Concentration of vitamin A averaged 0.28±0.03 µg/mL and riboflavin concentration averaged 1.57±0.13 µg/mL across treatments. The concentration of minerals in milk were similar for all treatments. Cows fed CON and NSP-1{\%} yielded the lowest concentration of AFM1 in milk with 0.03 and 0.01±0.06 µg/L. Addition of NSP reduced milk AFM1 from 1.10±0.06 µg/L with the AF diet to 0.58 and 0.32±0.06 µg/L with the NSP-0.5{\%}+AF and NSP-1{\%}+AF diets, respectively. Excretion of AFM1 was reduced by NSP; mean values were 24.38, 11.86, 7.38, 0.64, and 0.23, ± 1.71 µg/d, for AFD, NSP-0.5{\%}+AFD, NSP-1{\%}+AFD, NSP-1{\%}, and CON, respectively. More specifically, 1.07±0.08{\%} of the daily AF intake was transferred to the milk of cows consuming the AFD, whereas the AF transfer rates in milk from cows that consumed the NSP-0.5{\%}+AFD and NSP-1{\%}+AFD were 0.52 and 0.32±0.08{\%}. Results from this research demonstrate that feeding NSP to lactating cows is an effective method to reduce the transfer and excretion of AFM1 in milk with no negative effects on dry matter intake, milk production, and composition.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effects of advancing stage of maturity and additive treatment on the fermentation characteristics of three common grassland species. Perennial ryegrass (PRG; Lolium perenne L., var. Gandalf), timothy (Phleum pratense L., var. Erecta) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L., var. Merviot) were harvested at three dates in the primary growth (11 May, 8 June and 6 July; Harvests 1–3) and ensiled with the following additive treatments: (1) control (i.e. no treatment), (2) formic acid-based additive, (3) homofermentative lactic acid bacterial (LAB) inoculant and (4) heterofermentative LAB inoculant. Additive application to the PRG (irrespective of harvest date), the late-harvest timothy (Harvest 3) and the red clover (Harvests 2 and 3) herbages had little impact on silage fermentation characteristics, where a lactic acid dominant fermentation already prevailed. However, the application of the formic acid-based additive to the Harvest 1 and 2 timothy and Harvest 1 red clover herbages, where the silage fermentation characteristics were poorer, resulted in an increase in the proportion of lactic acid in total fermentation products and a decrease in pH. In contrast, the heterofermentative LAB inoculant had a negative impact on silage fermentation characteristics where a poor preservation prevailed in the corresponding control silage.},

abstract = {The utility of a relatively new multivariate method, bi-linear modelling by cross-validated partial least squares regression (PLSR), was investigated in the analysis of QTL. The distinguishing feature of PLSR is to reveal reliable covariance structures in data of different types with regard to the same set objects. Two matrices X (here: genetic markers) and Y (here: phenotypes) are interactively decomposed into latent variables (PLS components, or PCs) in a way which facilitates statistically reliable and graphically interpretable model building. Natural collinearities between input variables are utilized actively to stabilise the modelling, instead of being treated as a statistical problem. The importance of cross-validation/jack-knifing as an intuitively appealing way to avoid overfitting, is emphasized. Two datasets from chromosomal mapping studies of different complexity were chosen for illustration (QTL for tomato yield and for oat heading date). Results from PLSR analysis were compared to published results and to results using the package PLABQTL in these data sets. In all cases PLSR gave at least similar explained validation variances as the reported studies. An attractive feature is that PLSR allows the analysis of several traits/replicates in one analysis, and the direct visual identification of individuals with desirable marker genotypes. It is suggested that PLSR may be useful in structural and functional genomics and in marker assisted selection, particularly in cases with limited number of objects.},

abstract = {This study sought to investigate the effects of induced intermittent endotoxemia on plasma mediators of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, humoral immunity, and clinical health status in periparturient dairy cows. Sixteen pregnant Holstein cows were blocked by parity and day of calving, and were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 different treatment groups. Eight cows were infused intravenously (i.v.) with 100mL of sterile saline and served as the control group (CON). The other 8 cows were infused i.v. with 100mL of sterile saline containing 3 increasing doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), from Escherichia coli O111:B4, for 3 consecutive weeks during the 2 wk before and 1 wk after parturition as follows: (1) 0.01mug of LPS/kg of body weight (BW) on d -14 and -10; (2) 0.05mug of LPS/kg of BW on d -7 and -3; and (3) 0.1mug of LPS/kg of BW on d 3 and 7 postpartum. Nine blood samples were collected during the experimental period (i.e., from -14 to 28 d postpartum) and analyzed for calcium, zinc, iron, copper, glucose, lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), cholesterol, insulin, cortisol, serum amyloid A (SAA), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), haptoglobin (Hp), and anti-LPS IgA, IgG, and IgM. Results showed that intermittently induced endotoxemia decreased feed intake and milk production and triggered alterations in plasma cholesterol, BHBA, Hp, Ca, Cu, and anti-LPS IgG and IgM. All of these changes were associated with a greater number of cows affected by metabolic disorders such as left displaced abomasum (LDA, 2 from 8 LPS cows vs. 0 from 8 CON cows) and retained placenta (RP; 4 from 8 LPS cows vs. 0 from 8 CON cows). In addition, the discriminant analysis differently clustered the cow responses within LPS group, each corresponding to LDA, RP, and the cows displaying no clinical health problems (LPS-NO). The stepwise selection procedure of the best discriminant variables revealed that plasma Ca and anti-LPS IgG, as well as glucose and cortisol, were the best discriminating variables for cows affected by LDA, whereas NEFA and cholesterol better discriminated for cows affected by RP. This analysis also revealed that the cluster of plasma variables including plasma Cu, SAA, BHBA, and anti-LPS IgA were the best discrimination for the LPS-NO group. In conclusion, our results indicate a role of endotoxemia, during the periparturient period, in development of metabolic and immune disturbances, as well as in the etiopathology of displaced abomasum and retained placenta in dairy cows.},

@article{Moe1981,
abstract = {Energy metabolism research during the past 25 yr has resolved many uncertainties of energy use by lactating cows. Use of metabolizable energy for milk production essentially is unaffected by milk yield but is slightly influenced by its source. Estimates of efficiency of use for milk production (60 to 64{\%}) are lower than earlier estimates (69 to 70{\%}) primarily because of lower maintenance costs. Efficiency of metabolizable energy for body gain is higher in lactating (75{\%}) than nonlactating (60{\%}) cows. Use of body tissue energy for milk production is about 82{\%} efficient. End products of digestion contribute to variation in efficiency of fattening and in partition of energy between milk and body gain in the lactating animal. Energy use in the growing animal is influenced by composition of tissue gained and composition of the diet. Energetic efficiency of protein deposition is apparently much lower than that of fat deposition. A substantial part of the lower efficiency of protein deposition is related to energy costs of protein turnover. Incomplete digestion of mixed diets at high intake by lactating cows and methods to predict energy partition are serious practical problems. In the short term, improved methods to predict intake effects on metabolizable energy of mixed diets will increase accuracy of diet formulations. In the longer term, methods to predict quantities of nutrients absorbed from the gut will permit a more flexible and accurate method of evaluating diets and predicting animal performance.},

abstract = {To observe the effects of supplemental dietary d-$\alpha$-tocopherol in relation to dietary energy on growth and immune status in dairy calves, 32 newborn Holstein bull calves were assigned to 1 of 4 treatments for 5 wk in a 2×2 factorial, randomized complete block, split-plot design. Calves received moderate growth (MG) or low growth (LG) all-milk dietary treatments, formulated to support daily gains of 0.5 or 0.25kg/d, respectively, per the dietary energy recommendation for milk-fed calves according to the National Research Council's Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle. Calves in both groups were either injected i.m. with Vital E-A+D (injectable solution of vitamins E, A, and D) on d 1 and supplemented with Emcelle Tocopherol (micellized vitamin E) via milk daily (MG-S and LG-S), or were not supplemented (MG-C and LG-C) during the study period. Total weight gain of MG calves was greater than that of LG calves and tended to be greater in MG-S calves than in MG-C calves. Calves receiving vitamin supplementation demonstrated greater concentrations of plasma $\alpha$-tocopherol, retinol, and 25-(OH)-vitamin D than did control calves, whereas MG calves demonstrated a lower concentration of plasma $\alpha$-tocopherol than did LG calves. The apparent increased utilization of $\alpha$-tocopherol by MG calves was accompanied by a rise in serum haptoglobin, a positive acute-phase protein and indicator of inflammation, especially in MG-C calves. Serum amyloid A, also a positive acute-phase protein, was not different among groups, but was elevated from baseline in all groups during wk 1 through 3. Plasma IgG1 concentrations were higher in MG-S and LG-S calves than in their nonsupplemented dietary counterparts, whereas plasma IgG2, IgA, and IgM concentrations were not different among groups. In summary, dietary supplementation of d-$\alpha$-tocopherol improved plasma $\alpha$-tocopherol status and tended to increase growth in calves fed for 0.5 kg of average daily gain. Vitamin supplementation ameliorated the rise of serum haptoglobin associated with acute inflammation in MG calves, and may have improved passive transfer of maternal antibody. These results indicate a role for $\alpha$-tocopherol in prevention of proinflammatory state associated with greater dietary energy and onset of infectious disease.},

abstract = {The objective of our experiment was to evaluate the effects of prill size of a palmitic acid-enriched fatty acid supplement (PA; 85{\%} C16:0) on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and production responses of dairy cows. Twenty-four primiparous and multiparous Holstein cows were assigned based on parity and production level to replicated 4×4 Latin squares balanced for carryover effects with 21-d periods. Treatments were a control diet (no added PA), or 2.0{\%} PA added as a small prill size (PA-SM; 284±12.4µm), a medium prill size (PA-MD; 325±14.7µm), or a large prill size (PA-LG; 600±17.4µm) supplement. Overall, PA treatments increased milk fat content (4.25 vs. 3.99{\%}), milk fat yield (1.48 vs. 1.39kg/d), 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk (39.2 vs. 37.7kg/d), and improved feed efficiency (fat-corrected milk:dry matter intake; 1.51 vs. 1.42) compared with control. Compared with control, PA treatments did not affect dry matter intake, body weight, body condition score, or yields of milk, protein, and lactose. The PA treatments increased neutral detergent fiber digestibility (44.8 vs. 42.4{\%}) and reduced the digestibility of 16-carbon fatty acids (72.3 vs. 79.1{\%}) and total fatty acids (76.6 vs. 80.3{\%}). Compared with control, PA treatments reduced the contents of de novo synthesized milk fatty acids (23.0 vs. 25.8g/100g of fatty acids) and preformed milk fatty acids (36.3 vs. 39.1g/100g of fatty acids), but did not affect their yields. In contrast, PA treatments increased the content (40.8 vs. 35.1g/100g of fatty acids) and yield (570 vs. 436g/d) of 16-carbon milk fatty acids compared with control. The PA prill size had no effect on dry matter intake, yield of milk and milk components, or feed efficiency. However, PA-LG tended to increase milk fat content compared with PA-SM (4.28 vs. 4.22{\%}), and it increased 16-carbon fatty acid digestibility compared with PA-MD (74.2 vs. 71.0{\%}) and PA-SM (74.2 vs. 71.7{\%}). Additionally, PA-LG increased total fatty acid digestibility compared with PA-MD (78.1 vs. 75.6{\%}) and PA-SM (78.1 vs. 76.0{\%}). Results demonstrate that PA increased milk fat content and yield, and feed efficiency. Reducing prill size decreased fatty acid digestibility, but it had no effect on animal performance under the dietary conditions and prill sizes evaluated.},

abstract = {{\textless}title{\textgreater}Author Summary{\textless}/title{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Microbial minimal
generation times vary from a few minutes to several
weeks. The reasons for this disparity have been
thought to lie on different life-history strategies:
fast-growing microbes grow extremely fast in rich
media, but are less capable of dealing with stress
and/or poor nutrient conditions. Prokaryotes have
evolved a set of genomic traits to grow fast,
including biased codon usage and transient or
permanent gene multiplication for dosage
effects. Here, we studied the relative role of these
traits and show they can be used to predict minimal
generation times from the genomic data of the vast
majority of microbes that cannot be cultivated. We
show that this inference can also be made with
incomplete genomes and thus be applied to
metagenomic data to test hypotheses about the
biomass productivity of biotopes and the evolution
of microbiota in the human gut after birth. Our
results also allow a better understanding of the
co-evolution between growth rates and genomic traits
and how they can be manipulated in synthetic
biology. Growth rates have been a key variable in
microbial physiology studies in the last century,
and we show how intimately they are linked with
genome organization and prokaryotic ecology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} },

@article{sandor2008,
abstract = {Imprinted quantitative trait loci (QTL) are commonly
reported in studies using line-cross designs,
especially in livestock species. It was previously
shown that such parent-of-origin effects might
result from the nonfixation of QTL alleles in one or
both parental lines, rather than from genuine
molecular parental imprinting. We herein demonstrate
that if linkage disequilibrium exists between marker
loci and nonfixed QTL, spurious detection of
pseudo-imprinting is increased by an additional
40-80{\%} in scenarios mimicking typical livestock
situations. This is due to the fact that imprinting
can be tested only in F2 offspring whose sire and
dam have distinct marker genotypes. In the case of
linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTL, such
parents have a higher chance to have distinct QTL
genotypes as well, thus resulting in distinct
padumnal and madumnal allele substitution effects,
i.e., QTL pseudo-imprinting. },

Cows were 79 +/- 17 (mean +/- SD) DIM at the beginning of the experiment. Experimental diets with 40{\%} forage (corn silage and alfalfa silage) and 60{\%} concentrate contained 0, 6.1, 12.1, or 24.3{\%} beet pulp substituted for high-moisture corn on a DM basis. Diet concentrations of NDF and starch were 24.3 and 34.6{\%} (0{\%} beet pulp), 26.2 and 30.5{\%} (6{\%} beet pulp), 28.0, and 26.5{\%} (12{\%} beet pulp), and 31.6 and 18.4{\%} (24{\%} beet pulp), respectively. Substituting beet pulp for corn did not affect daily mean or minimum ruminal pH but tended to reduce pH range. Ruminal acetate:propionate responded in a positive exponential relationship to added beet pulp. Rate of valerate absorption from the rumen was not affected by treatment. Substituting beet pulp for corn up to 24{\%} of diet DM did not affect efficiency of ruminal microbial protein production, expressed as microbial N flow to the duodenum as a percentage of OM truly digested in the rumen. Microbial efficiency was not correlated to mean pH or daily minimum pH. While microbial efficiency was not directly related to concentration of beet pulp fed, it was positively correlated with passage rate of particulate matter, as represented by starch and indigestible NDF, probably due to reduced turnover of microbial protein in the rumen.},

In this work, the chemical composition of the lipids in BSG was studied in detail by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The predominant lipids were triglycerides (67{\%} of total extract), followed by a series of free fatty acids (18{\%}). Lower amounts of monoglycerides (1.6{\%}) and diglycerides (7.7{\%}) were also identified among the lipids in BSG, together with minor amounts of other aliphatic series such as n-alkanes and alkylresorcinols. Steroid compounds (steroid hydrocarbons, steroid ketones, free sterols, sterol esters and sterol glycosides) were also found in important amounts in BSG (ca. 5{\%}), with free and conjugated sterols being the most abundant steroids. BSG can thus be regarded as a valuable source of phytochemicals of interest for the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food or other industries. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Several studies and a 2013 meta-analysis have proposed that increased feeding of milk or milk replacer to neonatal calves may improve subsequent milk production. However, data from individual studies are conflicting, and the meta-analysis was unable to assess the influence of calf starter intake. The objective of the current meta-analysis was to review newly published data and evaluate the effects of preweaning diet (including calf starter intake) and growth rate on first-lactation milk, fat, and protein yield. Data from 9 studies representing 21 treatment groups were included in the analysis. We created separate models for each outcome variable using regression methods in SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to determine the effects of intake and growth rate. We then selected the best-fitting models using Akaike's information criterion. The effect of study explained 98, 85, and 96{\%} of the variance in 305-d milk, fat, and protein yield in first lactation, respectively, indicating that other aspects of management are more important for determining first-lactation production than preweaning intake and growth rate. However, we found a synergistic relationship between preweaning liquid and starter dry matter intake for improving milk, fat, and protein production, and a positive relationship between first-lactation performance and preweaning average daily gain. These data indicate that provision of adequate nutrients from liquid and solid feeds and maintaining average daily gain above 0.5kg/d can enhance the first-lactation performance of heifers when combined with proper postweaning practices.},

the health of the dairy cow and her calf. This paper
attempts to highlight Journal of Dairy Science
articles that have linked nutrition and nutritional
strategies to reduce disease incidence on the dairy
farm. Disorders associated with an animal's
inability to cope with the demands of high
production include diseases such as milk fever and
ketosis, which clearly are related to the cow's
inability to maintain bodily functions in the face
of negative calcium or energy balance. Improved
nutrition of the late gestation cow can reduce the
incidence of some of these disorders. Susceptibility
to infectious disease is dependent on the integrity
of the immune system, and recent studies have shed
light on nutritional factors that affect leukocyte
function. Other disorders, such as retained fetal
membranes, udder edema, and displacement of the
abomasum are not easily categorized as to their
cause, but nutritional strategies have been
developed to help prevent these disorders as well.

abstract = {A longitudinal study involving 73 primiparous (PP) and 47 multiparous (MP) Holstein cows was conducted over an 8-month period to assess the associations between locomotion score (LCS) and milk production, dry matter intake (DMI), feeding behaviour, and number of visits to an automatic milking system (AMS). Twice weekly, all cows were locomotion scored (scale 1-5) by the same observer. Individual eating behaviour and individual feed consumption at each cow visit to the feed troughs, individual milk production, the time of milking, and the number of milkings for each cow were recorded for the day of locomotion scoring and the day before and after. Dependent variables, such as milk yield, DMI, etc. were modelled using a mixed-effects model with parity, LCS, days in milk (DIM), the exponential of -0.05 DIM, and the interaction between parity and LCS, as fixed effects and random intercepts and random slopes for the linear and the exponential of -0.05DIM effects within cow. LCS did not affect time of attendance at feed troughs, but affected the location that cows occupied in the feed troughs. The time devoted to eating and DMI decreased with increasing LCS. Milk production decreased with LCS{\textgreater}3. The number of daily visits to the AMS also decreased with increasing LCS. The cows with high LCS were fetched more often than the cows with low LCS. Overall, PP cows were more sensitive to the effects of increasing LCS than were MP cows. The decrease in milk production observed with increasing LCS seemed to be affected similarly by the decrease in DMI and by the decrease in number of daily visits to the AMS. A further economic loss generated by lame cows with AMS will be associated with the additional labour needed to fetch them.},

Treatments were a control diet (CON; no added PA), or 1.5{\%} of FA added either as a FA supplement (PA-FA), or a TG supplement (PA-TG). PA replaced soyhulls and diets were balanced for glycerol content. Diets contained ({\%} DM) 21{\%} forage NDF, 17{\%} CP, and 26{\%} starch. Periods were 21 d in length with the final  d used for sample and data collection The statistical model included the random effect of cow and the fixed effect of treatment, period and interaction between treatment and period. Two preplanned contrasts were used to evaluate: 1) the overall effect of PA treatments [CON vs. PA; 1/2 (PA-FA + PA-TG)]; and 2) the effect of PA as a FA or triglyceride supplement (PA-FA vs. PA-TG). PA treatments increased milk fat content (3.60 vs. 3.41{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01), milk fat yield (1.69 vs. 1.60 kg/d; P {\textless} 0.01), yield of 16-carbon milk FA (570 vs. 471 g/d; P {\textless} 0.01), 3.5{\%} FCM (47.6 vs. 46.5 kg/d; P ), and feed efficiency ( FCMDMI  vs  P {\textless} 0.01).

abstract = {Certain diets cause a marked reduction in milk fat production in ruminants. Commonly referred to as milk fat depression (MFD), the mechanism involves an interrelationship between rumen microbial processes and tissue metabolism. Numerous theories to explain this interrelationship have been proposed and investigations offer little support for theories that are based on a limitation in the supply of lipogenic precursors. Rather, the basis involves alterations in rumen biohydrogenation of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids and a specific inhibition of mammary synthesis of milk fat. The biohydrogenation theory proposes that under certain dietary conditions, typical pathways of rumen biohydrogenation are altered to produce unique fatty acid intermediates that inhibit milk fat synthesis. Trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been identified as one example that is correlated with the reduction in milk fat. Investigations with pure isomers have shown that trans-10, cis-12 CLA is a potent inhibitor of milk fat synthesis, and similar to diet-induced MFD, the mechanism involves a coordinated reduction in mRNA abundance for key enzymes involved in the biochemical pathways of fat synthesis. A more complete identification of these naturally produced inhibitors of fat synthesis and delineation of cellular mechanisms may offer broader opportunities for application and understanding of the regulation of lipid metabolism.},

abstract = {Cattle that are not pregnant to first fixed-time artificial insemination (TAI) may be resynchronized for a second TAI if they are found nonpregnant at pregnancy diagnosis. The specific interval between first and second TAI ranges from 4 to 8 wk. The selected interval depends on the available method of pregnancy diagnosis and the efficiency of the resynchronization program. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate a pregnancy diagnosis and resynchronization system that achieved a 21-d interval between TAI. This 21-d interval approximates the natural return-to-service interval. It also enables resynchronization to be implemented within the same estrous cycle in which cattle are first inseminated. Holstein heifers were randomly assigned to a 21-d resynchronization program (21d{\_}resynch; n = 40) or a control group in which estrus was observed for the purpose of re-insemination (control; n = 29). The 21d{\_}resynch heifers were diagnosed for pregnancy on d 18 after a TAI (d 0) by using predetermined cut-off values for 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (Oas1) gene expression in leukocytes and plasma progesterone concentration. Heifers that were not pregnant to first TAI had greater expression of Oas1 at the time of PGF(2$\alpha$) (d -3) than pregnant heifers, but this relationship was reversed on d 18 after TAI: the heifers that were pregnant to first TAI had almost 5-fold greater expression of Oas1 compared with nonpregnant heifers. Nonpregnant heifers in the 21d{\_}resynch group were injected with a luteolytic dose of PGF(2$\alpha$) on d 19 and were injected with GnRH on d 21 and submitted to TAI. The pregnancy per AI after first insemination was similar for 21d{\_}resynch (50.0{\%}; pregnancy diagnosis on d 18) and control (51.7{\%}; pregnancy diagnosis on d 27). Likewise, no difference was detected in second insemination pregnancy per AI for 21d{\_}resynch (36.8{\%}; nonpregnant heifers TAI on d 21) and control (35.7{\%}; nonpregnant heifers inseminated at return to estrus or after nonpregnant diagnosis on d 27). The interval between first and second insemination was shorter for 21d{\_}resynch compared with control (21.0 ± 0 and 27.5 ± 2.1 d). The conclusion is that a TAI resynchronization can be programmed within 21 d of previous TAI when a d 18 pregnancy test and a rapid resynchronization are used.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to define alternative traits of somatic cell count (SCC) that can be used to decrease genetic susceptibility to clinical and subclinical mastitis (CM and SCM, respectively). Three kinds of SCC traits were evaluated: 1) lactation-averages of SCC, 2) traits derived from the proportion of test-day SCC above 150,000 cells/mL, and 3) patterns of peaks in SCC. Genetic parameters for these SCC traits and their genetic correlation with CM and SCM were estimated; CM and SCM were scored as binary traits. Two data sets (A and B) depending on CM recording were available. After editing, subset A contained 28,688 lactations from 21,673 cows in 394 herds. Subset B contained 56,726 lactations of 30,145 cows in 272 herds. Variance components for sire and permanent animal effects were estimated. Estimated heritabilities for all mastitis traits were around 0.03. Heritabilities for SCC traits ranged from 0.01 for patterns of peaks in SCC to 0.13 for lactation-average SCC. Genetic correlations between SCC traits and CM or SCM ranged from 0.55 to 0.93 for CM and from 0.55 to 0.98 for SCM. High genetic correlations were estimated between CM and SCC averaged over 250 d in milk (0.87), and between SCM and presence of test-day SCC {\textgreater}150,000 cells/mL (0.98) in subset A. In subset B, a high genetic correlation was estimated between CM and an SCC peak with a quick recovery (0.93) and between SCM and SCC averaged between 151 and 400 d (0.95). Partial genetic correlations were calculated to investigate the additional information of the alternative SCC traits, compared with lactation-average SCC. They showed that some traits remain informative for CM and others for SCM. Therefore, use of information from a combination of different SCC traits may be more successful in improving overall udder health than the traditional single SCC measure.},

abstract = {Efficient methods for processing genomic data were
developed to increase reliability of estimated
breeding values and to estimate thousands of marker
effects simultaneously. Algorithms were derived and
computer programs tested with simulated data for
2,967 bulls and 50,000 markers distributed randomly
across 30 chromosomes. Estimation of genomic
inbreeding coefficients required accurate estimates
of allele frequencies in the base population. Linear
model predictions of breeding values were computed
by 3 equivalent methods: 1) iteration for individual
allele effects followed by summation across loci to
obtain estimated breeding values, 2) selection index
including a genomic relationship matrix, and 3)
mixed model equations including the inverse of
genomic relationships. A blend of first- and
second-order Jacobi iteration using 2 separate
relaxation factors converged well for allele
frequencies and effects. Reliability of predicted
net merit for young bulls was 63{\%} compared with 32{\%}
using the traditional relationship matrix. Nonlinear
predictions were also computed using iteration on
data and nonlinear regression on marker deviations;
an additional (about 3{\%}) gain in reliability for
young bulls increased average reliability to
66{\%}. Computing times increased linearly with number
of genotypes. Estimation of allele frequencies
required 2 processor days, and genomic predictions
required {\textless}1 d per trait, and traits were processed
in parallel. Information from genotyping was
equivalent to about 20 daughters with phenotypic
records. Actual gains may differ because the
simulation did not account for linkage
disequilibrium in the base population or selection
in subsequent generations. },

segregation or linkage analyses, the likelihood of

determining peeling order is related to a problem in
solving systems of symmetric sparse linear

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS), as zootechnical feed ingredients, are widely used in animal nutrition. MOS has been commercially available since the launch of Bio-Mos{\textregistered} in the early 1990's and has a substantial body of scientific papers and practical examples of its efficacy. Since 1999, the use of MOS in animal feed has become more prominent, mainly due to the European ban on prophylactic antibiotic growth promoters in animal feed. MOS, with its ability to bind and limit the colonisation of gut pathogens, has proven to be an effective solution for antibiotic-free diets, as well as providing support for immunity and digestion. MOS has been shown to improve gastrointestinal health, thus improving wellbeing, energy levels and performance.

In 2009, a mannose-rich fraction (MRF) product was commercially launched as a ‘second generation' of these MOS-type products, with enhanced activities in immune modulation and intestinal health.

abstract = {The objective was to investigate the effect of different dry cow feeding strategies on the volume, concentration of IgG and insulin, as well as fatty acid composition of colostrum. Our hypothesis was that different dry period diets formulated to resemble current feeding practices on commercial dairy farms and differing in plane of energy would have an effect on IgG and insulin concentration, as well as composition of fatty acid of colostrum. Animals (n=84) entering parity 2 or greater were dried off 57d before expected parturition and fed either a diet formulated to meet, but not greatly exceed energy requirements throughout the dry period (CON), or a higher energy density diet, supplying approximately 150{\%} of energy requirements (HI). A third group received the same diet as group CON from dry-off until 29d before expected parturition. After this time point, from 28d before expected parturition until calving, they received a diet formulated to supply approximately 125{\%} of energy requirements (I-med). Concentration of IgG and insulin in colostrum were measured by radial immunodiffusion and RIA, respectively. Composition of fatty acids was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The IgG concentration was highest in colostrum of cows in group CON [96.1 (95{\%} CI: 83.3-108.9) g/L] and lowest in group HI [72.4 (60.3-84.5) g/L], whereas insulin concentration was highest in group HI [1,105 (960-1,250) $\mu$U/mL] and lowest in group CON [853 (700-1,007) $\mu$U/mL]. Colostrum yield did not differ between treatments and was 5.9 (4.5-7.4), 7.0 (5.6-8.4), and 7.3 (5.9-8.7) kg in groups CON, I-med, and HI, respectively. A multivariable linear regression model showed the effect of dietary treatment group on IgG concentration was independent of the effect of dry matter. Cows in groups CON, I-med, and HI had an average colostral fat percentage of 5.0 (4.1-5.9), 5.6 (4.8-6.4), and 6.0 (5.2-6.8) and an average fat yield of 289 (196-380), 406 (318-495), and 384 (295-473) g, respectively. Colostrum of cows fed to exceed predicted energy requirements during the last 4wk of the dry period (groups I-med and HI) exhibited a higher concentration and yield of de novo fatty acid and lower concentrations but similar yield of preformed fatty acid compared with cows in group CON. Feeding a controlled energy diet during the dry period increased colostral IgG concentration in this study, whereas overall colostrum yield was not affected. Exceeding energy requirements during the period of colostrogenesis led to higher concentrations of insulin and de novo fatty acid in colostrum.},

abstract = {Digestibility of commercial fat supplements was determined in two experiments with high (59{\%} of diet DM) forage diets. Experiment 1 was a preliminary trial in which six Jersey cows were in two 3 x 3 Latin squares to evaluate two formulations of calcium soap at two intake levels (500 and 1000 g/d). The two formulations were compared with control (0 supplement) within squares; the squares differed in amount of soap supplemented. Mean apparent digestibilities of fat were not influenced by source or amount of fat supplemented and averaged 82.5, 84.3, and 83.4{\%} for control, 500, and 1000 g/d. In Experiment 2, six Jersey cows were in a 6 x 6 Latin square to compare effects of various commercial fats on digestibility of diet components at 2.85 and 5.7{\%} (DM) added fat. Higher fat decreased digestibility of P and fatty acid. Fatty acid intake affected fatty acid digestibility quadratically, and variability among cows increased at higher fatty acid intake. Endogenous fecal fat was 55.9 g/d; apparent digestibility of fat was relatively constant at 80 to 82{\%} between 2 and 5{\%} of diet DM, whereas marginal true digestibility decreased linearly (4.4{\%} units/100 g fatty acid consumed). There were no differences among fat sources in fatty acid digestibility. Rumen VFA were not influenced by dietary fat.},

abstract = {Multiparous Holstein cows (n=60) were used to determine effects of supplementing hydroxy forms of Zn, Cu, and Mn compared with 2 other common supplementation strategies on oxidative metabolism, cytological endometritis, and performance of transition cows. After a 1-wk pretreatment period, cows were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 dietary treatments from 21d before expected calving through 84d postcalving. Dietary treatments administered by daily top-dressing included (1) inorganic sulfate forms of Zn, Cu, and Mn (ITM); (2) a blend (75:25) of sulfates and organic complexes of Zn, Cu, and Mn (ITM/OTM); and (3) hydroxy trace minerals (HTM) of Zn, Cu, and Mn. The resulting dietary concentrations of supplemental Zn, Cu, and Mn were similar among treatments and averaged 40, 10, and 27mg/kg, respectively, before calving and 59, 15, and 40mg/kg, respectively, after calving. Total concentrations of Zn, Cu, and Mn averaged 80, 16, and 62mg/kg during the prepartum period and 102, 23, and 75mg/kg, respectively, during the postpartum period. Overall, effects of treatment on milk yield and milk composition were not significant. Cows fed HTM during the prepartum period had higher body weight (BW) than those fed ITM during the prepartum period and had higher BW during the postpartum period than those fed the other treatments; however, BW change, body condition score, and body condition score change were not affected by treatment. Plasma total antioxidant capacity was lower in cows fed HTM than ITM but was not different from cows fed ITM/OTM. Cows fed HTM tended to have lower concentrations of plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances than those fed ITM during the whole study period, but plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were not different between HTM and ITM/OTM. Plasma haptoglobin was lower in cows fed HTM than ITM/OTM at 1wk postpartum. Endometrial cytology 7d postcalving and cytological endometritis as assessed on 1d between 40 and 60d postcalving was not affected by treatment. In conclusion, supplementation with HTM sources of Zn, Cu, and Mn modulated plasma variables related to oxidative metabolism compared with supplementation with ITM; however, HTM and ITM/OTM resulted in similar responses. Furthermore, the source of trace minerals did not affect performance or uterine health in this experiment.},

abstract = {Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRD) is a common disease in weaned dairy calves that incurs economic and welfare costs. This study was an extension of a randomized clinical trial in which a single injection of tulathromycin (TUL) or oxytetracycline (TET) was administered at first movement to group housing for the prevention of BRD in the 60 d following antimicrobial treatment (BRD60). Calves treated with TUL were 0.5 times [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.4 to 0.7] as likely to be treated for BRD60 as calves treated with TET. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate the long-term effects of BRD and antibiotic treatment on growth of heifers until breeding age, age at first calving, incidence of dystocia, milk production, and mortality before first calving and mortality before 120 d in milk. At entry to the breeding barn (382 d of age), calves that experienced BRD60 weighed 16.0±2.3 kg less than calves that did not. Survival to first calving was recorded for 98{\%} (1,343/1,392) of the heifers on this trial. For TET and TUL heifers with BRD60, 63{\%} (94/150) and 73{\%} (64/88) survived to first lactation, respectively. For TET and TUL calves without BRD60, 84{\%} (436/517) and 84{\%} (494/588) survived to first lactation, respectively. The median age at first calving for heifers with and without BRD60 was 714 (95{\%} CI: 705-723) and 702 (95{\%} CI: 699-705) days, respectively. Heifers with BRD60 were 1.5 (95{\%} CI: 1.1-2.2) times more likely to have a calving ease score ≥2 at their first calving compared with heifers without BRD60. The administration of TUL at movement to group housing may have a role in the prevention of BRD and in mitigating some of the long-term effects of this disease.},

abstract = {Negative energy balance during early postpartum is associated with reduced reproductive performance in dairy cows. A pooled statistical analysis of 7 studies completed in our group from 1993 to 2010 was conducted to investigate the association between prepartum energy feeding regimen and reproductive performance. The interval from calving to pregnancy (days to pregnancy, DTP) was the dependent variable to assess reproductive performance. Individual data for 408 cows (354 multiparous and 54 primiparous) were included in the analysis. The net energy for lactation (NEL) intake was determined from each cow's average dry matter intake and calculated dietary NEL density. Treatments applied prepartum were classified as either controlled-energy (CE; limited NEL intake to ≤100{\%} of requirement) or high-energy (HE; cows were allowed to consume {\textgreater}100{\%}) diets fed during the far-off (FO) or close-up (CU) dry periods. Cow was the experimental unit. The Cox proportional hazard model revealed that days to pregnancy was shorter for CE (median=157d) than HE (median=167d) diets during the CU period [hazard ratio (HR)=0.70]. Cows fed HE diets during the last 4wk prepartum lost more body condition score in the first 6wk postpartum than those fed CE diets (-0.43 and -0.30, respectively). Cows fed CE diets during the FO period had lower nonesterified fatty acids concentrations in wk 1, 2, and 3 of lactation than cows fed HE diets. Higher nonesterified fatty acids concentration in wk 1 postpartum was associated with a greater probability of disease (n=251; odds ratio=1.18). Cows on the CE regimen during the FO period had greater plasma glucose concentrations during wk 1 and 3 after calving than cows fed the HE regimen. Higher plasma glucose (HG) concentration compared with lower glucose (LG) in wk 3 (HG: n=154; LG: n=206) and wk 4 (HG: n=71; LG: n=254) after calving was associated with shorter days to pregnancy (wk 3: median=151 and 171d for HG and LG, respectively, and HR=1.3; wk 4: median=148 and 167d, respectively, and HR=1.4). In the first 2wk after calving, cows that received HE diets in the FO period had higher concentrations of total lipids and triglyceride and greater ratio of triglyceride to glycogen in liver than cows fed CE diets. In conclusion, cows fed CE diets during the CU period had a shorter interval between parturition and conception, which may be explained by increased NEL intake during the first 4wk postpartum and lower incidence of peripartal diseases. Lower body condition score loss during the first 6wk postpartum and slightly higher glucose concentration at wk 3 likely contributed to improved reproductive performance.},

abstract = {The optimal time of artificial insemination (AI) was determined from data for 2661 AI in 17 herds utilizing a radiotelemetric system for estrus detection that has the potential for continuous 24-h surveillance to monitor behavioral events associated with estrus. The system consisted of pressure-sensitive radio frequency transmitters affixed over the sacrum region of cows. The activation of the sensor sent a radiotelemetric signal to a microcomputer via a fixed antenna. Cow identification, date, time, and duration of each standing event were recorded in the software program provided with the system. Each farm selected a 3-h interval to AI for cows that were identified in estrus during the previous 24 h. Pregnancy status was determined from data for return to estrus and palpation of the uterus 35 to 75 d following AI. Standing events during estrus averaged (+/- SD) 8.5 +/- 6.6 per cow, and the number of events per estrus across herds averaged from 6.2 +/- 5.1 to 12.8 +/- 9.9 per cow. The duration of estrus ranged from 5.1 +/- 3.8 to 10.6 +/- 6.8 h across herds; the mean was 7.1 +/- 5.4 h. The interval from the first standing event to AI affected the probability of pregnancy; the highest conception rates for AI occurred between 4 and 12 h after the onset of standing activity. The probability of pregnancy was higher for cows {\textgreater} 100 d in milk, exhibiting {\textgreater} 2 standing events during estrus, and inseminated during March, April or May.},

abstract = {It is unclear why some cows fail to expel the placenta following calving. One theory suggests the fetal placenta must be recognized as "foreign" tissue and rejected by the immune system after parturition to cause expulsion of the placenta. We hypothesized that impaired neutrophil function causes retained placenta (RP). We examined the ability of neutrophils to recognize fetal cotyledon tissue as assessed by a chemotaxis assay, which utilized a placental homogenate obtained from a spontaneously expelled placenta as the chemoattractant. Neutrophil killing ability was also estimated by determining myeloperoxidase activity in isolated neutrophils. Blood samples were obtained from 142 periparturient dairy cattle in two herds. Twenty cattle developed RP (14.1{\%}). Neutrophils isolated from blood of cows with RP had significantly lower neutrophil function in both assays before calving, and this impaired function lasted for 1 to 2 wk after parturition. The addition of antibody directed against interleukin-8 (IL-8) to the cotyledon preparation used as a chemoattractant inhibited chemotaxis by 41{\%}, suggesting that one of the chemoattractants present in the cotyledon at parturition is IL-8. At calving, plasma IL-8 concentration was lower in RP cows (51 +/- 12 pg/ml) than in cows expelling the placenta normally (134 +/- 11 pg/ml). From these data, we suggest that neutrophil function is a determining factor for the development of RP in dairy cattle. Also, depressed production of IL-8 may be a factor affecting neutrophil function in cows developing RP.},

abstract = {Our objective was to determine dietary energy effects on feed intake, internal fat deposition, body condition score (BCS), visceral organ mass, and blood analytes in Holstein cows. Eighteen nonpregnant, nonlactating cows (BCS=3.04±0.25) were blocked based on initial BCS and were randomly assigned within each block to 2 treatments. Treatments were either high energy [HE; net energy for lactation (NEL)=1.62 Mcal/kg] or low energy (LE; NEL=1.35 Mcal/kg) diets fed as total mixed rations for 8 wk. The LE diet consisted of 81.7{\%} forage, including 40.5{\%} wheat straw and 28.3{\%} corn silage, whereas the HE diet contained 73.8{\%} forage with no straw and 49.9{\%} corn silage (dry matter basis). Cows were fed for ad libitum intake once daily at 0800h. Feed intake was recorded daily, blood was sampled at wk 1, 4, and 7, and BCS was assigned at wk 1, 4, and 7. Cows were killed following the 8-wk period, and visceral organs, mammary gland, and internal adipose tissues were weighed and sampled. The HE group had greater dry matter intake (15.9 vs. 11.2±0.5 kg/d) and energy intakes than cows fed LE, but neutral detergent fiber intake did not differ (5.8 vs. 5.6±0.25 kg/d for HE and LE). Final body weight was greater for cows fed HE (807 vs. 750kg), but BCS did not differ between groups (3.52 vs. 3.47 for HE and LE). Omental (26.8 vs. 15.2±1.6 kg/d), mesenteric (21.5 vs. 11.2±1.9kg), and perirenal (8.9 vs. 5.4±0.9kg) adipose tissue masses were larger in HE cows than in LE cows. Although subcutaneous adipose mass was not measured, carcass weight (including hide and subcutaneous fat) did not differ between HE (511kg) and LE (496kg). Liver weight tended to be greater for cows fed HE, but weights of gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidney did not differ. Serum insulin tended to be greater and the glucose to insulin ratio was lower for cows fed HE. Serum concentrations of $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate and cholesterol were greater for HE cows than for LE cows but concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, total protein, and albumin did not differ. Final BCS was correlated with masses of omental (r=0.57), mesenteric (r=0.59), and perirenal (r=0.72) adipose tissue, but mesenteric adipose mass increased more as BCS increased for cows fed HE. The similar final BCS between HE and LE cows demonstrates that BCS may lack sensitivity to detect differences in visceral fat deposition that might increase risk for peripartal diseases and disorders.},

@article{Tamminga2006,
abstract = {Reproduction in dairy cattle is negatively affected by a negative energy balance (NEB), a combination of the deposition or mobilisation of fat and protein. The mode of action of NEB on fertility is not always clear, but the severity, length, and probably also the nature of the NEB may be involved. Extensive mobilisation of fat is expected to have detrimental effects on liver function due to the accumulation of non-esterified long chain fatty acids, impairing the detoxification of ammonia into urea. Protein evaluation systems nowadays use the concept of metabolisable protein (MP) and distinguish between rumen degradable protein (RDP) and rumen undegradable protein (RUP). Mobilisation of protein itself does not seem to have negative effects on reproduction. However, when protein is extensively degraded in the rumen or used as an energy source, metabolic residues like ammonia and urea will result. Such residues may exert metabolic effects that are often detrimental to reproduction and fertility. Ammonia is believed to play a role starting before ovulation, whereas urea mainly interferes negatively after fertilisation. But, urea is also believed to aggravate the severity of NEB and its effect on fertility by preventing or delaying the start of cyclicity. Besides, urea has been shown to lower the pH in the uterine fluid, giving rise to disturbances in follicular development and embryonic growth. It is recommended to limit the level of rumen degradable protein in the diet to 10{\%} in the DM. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Canadian beef consumption is approximately 31 kg per annum, or a third of all meats consumed. Beef is a nutrient-rich food, providing good quality protein, vitamins B-6 and B-12, niacin, iron, and zinc. However, animal fats have gained the reputation of being less healthy. The identification of the anticarcinogenic effects of beef extracts due to the presence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has heightened interest in increasing the amount of CLA deposited in beef. Beef cattle produce CLA and deposit these compounds in the meat; thus, beef consumers can receive bioformed CLA. Beef contains both of the bioactive CLA isomers, namely, cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12. The relative content of these CLA isomers in beef depends on the feeds consumed by the animals during production. Feeding cattle linoleic acid-rich oils for extended periods of time increases the CLA content of beef. Depending on the type and relative maturity of the pasture, beef from pasture-fed cattle may have a higher CLA content than beef from grain- or silage-fed cattle. In feedlot animals fed high-grain diets, inclusion of dietary oil along with hay during both the growth and finishing phases led to an increase in CLA content from 2.8 to 14 mg/g beef fat, which would provide 77 mg CLA in an 85-g serving of beef. The CLAs appear to be concentrated in intramuscular and subcutaneous fat of beef cattle, with the CLA trans-10, cis-12 isomer being greater in the subcutaneous fat.},

Expansion of the biofuels industry has increased the availability of glycerol as an alternative feed for dairy cows. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of glycerol on feed intake, milk production, rumen volatile fatty acids, and metabolic parameters in transition dairy cows. Multiparous Holstein cows were fed diets containing either high-moisture corn (n = 11) or glycerol (n = 12) from -28 to +56 d relative to calving. Glycerol was included at 11.5 and 10.8{\%} of the ration dry matter for the pre- and postpartum diets, respectively. Prepartum feed intake was not changed by glycerol feeding (14.9 vs. 14.6 kg/d, control vs. glycerol) nor did postpartum feed intake differ (19.8 vs. 20.7 kg/d, control vs. glycerol). Overall milk yield did not differ (35.8 vs. 37 kg/d, control vs. glycerol) and milk composition, milk urea nitrogen, somatic cells, and energy balance were not different with glycerol feeding. Blood glucose content was decreased in cows fed glycerol during the prepartum period (59.1 vs. 53.4 mg/dL), and [beta]-hydroxybutyrate concentration was increased (0.58 vs. 0.82 mmol/L, control vs. glycerol). Concentrations of blood nonesterified fatty acids did not differ between the treatment groups, and no response to glycerol for blood metabolites during the postpartum period was observed. Total rumen volatile fatty acid concentrations (mmol/L) did not differ between treatments, but proportions of rumen propionate and butyrate were greater for cows fed glycerol (22.7 vs. 28.6{\%} of propionate, control vs. glycerol; and 11.5 vs. 15.3{\%} of butyrate, control vs. glycerol) at the expense of acetate (61.4 vs. 51.5{\%}, control vs. glycerol). These data indicate that glycerol is a suitable replacement for corn grain in diets for transition dairy cows.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effect of metabolizable protein (MP) supply and rumen-protected (RP) Lys and Met supplementation on productivity, nutrient digestibility, urinary N losses, apparent total-tract digestibility of dietary AA, and the efficiency of AA utilization for milk protein synthesis in dairy cows. The experiment was conducted with 8 ruminally cannulated Holstein cows in a replicated 4×4 Latin square design trial with 21-d periods. Treatments were (1) MP-adequate diet (AMP; MP balance of -24 g/d); (2) MP-deficient diet (DMP; MP balance of -281 g/d); (3) DMP supplemented with 100 g of RPLys/cow per day (estimated digestible Lys supply=24 g/d; DMPL; MP balance of -305g/d); and (4) DMPL supplemented with 24 g of RPMet/cow per day (estimated digestible Met supply=15 g/d; DMPLM; MP balance of -256g/d). Diet had no effect on total-tract nutrient digestibility, milk production, and milk composition, but the DMP diets decreased urinary N excretion and the ammonia emitting potential of manure. Plasma Met concentration was increased by DMPLM compared with AMP. Supplementation with RPLys had no effect on plasma Lys. Concentration of most AA in milk protein was increased or tended to be increased by DMPLM compared with DMPL. Except for the AA supplemented as RPAA (i.e., Met and Lys), apparent total-tract digestibility of all dietary AA was generally greater for the DMP diets and ranged from 33{\%} (Arg, AMP diet) to 67{\%} (Thr, DMPL diet). Apparent recovery of dietary AA in milk protein followed the same trends, being greater for the DMP diets than AMP and generally lower for Lys and Met with the RPAA-supplemented diets versus AMP and DMP. The RPAA were apparently not used for milk protein synthesis in the conditions of this experiment. The AA recoveries in milk protein varied from around 17{\%} (Ala) to 70{\%} (Pro). Milk protein recoveries of essential AA (EAA) were around 54{\%} for the DMP diet and 49{\%} for AMP. The estimated efficiency of utilization of digestible EAA for milk protein synthesis was generally greater for the DMP diets compared with AMP. In this trial, blood plasma Lys and Met were labeled by abomasal pulse-dose of 15N-Lys and 13C-Met (respectively). Analysis of the 15N-Lys and 13C-Met decay curves in plasma indicated trends for a faster extraction of Lys and Met from plasma for the MP-deficient diets, compared with AMP. Overall, this study confirmed conclusions from previous analyses that the efficiency of utilization of dietary EAA will increase with decreasing MP-AA supply.},

abstract = {Relationships between air quality, a variety of environmental risk factors, and calf respiratory health were studied in 13 naturally ventilated calf barns during winter. A minimum of 12 preweaned calves were randomly selected and scored for the presence of respiratory disease in each barn. An air sampling device was used to determine airborne bacteria colony-forming units per cubic meter (cfu/m3) of air in calf pens and central alleys within the barns. Airborne bacteria samples were collected on sheep blood agar (BAP) and eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar plates. Temperature and relative humidity were recorded in each calf pen, the barn alley, and outside the barn. Samples of bedding were collected in each pen and DM was measured. Pen bedding type and a calf nesting score (degree to which the calves could nestle into the bedding) was assigned to each barn. Calf numbers, barn and pen dimensions, ridge, eave, and curtain openings, and exterior wind speed and direction were determined and used to estimate building ventilation rates. Factors that were significantly associated with a reduced prevalence of respiratory disease were reduced pen bacterial counts (log10 cfu/m3) on BAP, presence of a solid barrier between each calf pen, and increased ability to nest. Individual calf pen bacterial counts were significantly different from barn alley bacterial counts on both BAP and EMB. Significant factors associated with reduced calf pen bacterial counts on BAP were increasing pen area, increasing number of open planes of the calf pen, decreasing pen temperature, and wood-particle bedding. Significant factors associated with reduced alley bacterial counts on BAP were increased ventilation changes per hour, increased barn volume per kilogram of calf, reduced pen bacterial counts, and barn type.},

All diets contained ({\%} of DM) 21{\%} alfalfa silage and 35{\%} corn silage plus 1) 2{\%} urea plus 41{\%} high-moisture shelled corn (HMSC), 2) 12{\%} SSBM plus 31{\%} HMSC, 3) 14{\%} CSM plus 29{\%} HMSC, or 4) 16{\%} CM plus 27{\%} HMSC. Crude protein was equal across diets, averaging 16.6{\%}. Intake and production were substantially reduced, and milk urea, blood urea, and ruminal ammonia were increased on urea vs. the diets supplemented with true protein. Although intake was lower in cows fed SSBM compared with CM, no differences were observed for milk yield among SSBM, CSM, and CM. Yields of fat and protein both were lower on CSM than on CM, whereas SSBM was intermediate. Milk urea and milk protein contents also decreased when CSM replaced SSBM or CM. Diet did not affect ruminal volatile fatty acids except that isobutyrate concentration was lowest on urea, intermediate on CSM, and greatest on SSBM and CM. Urinary excretion of urea N and total N was greatest on urea, intermediate on SSBM and CM, and lowest on CSM. Apparent N efficiency (milk N/N intake) was lower on the CSM diet than on the SSBM diet. Overall, production and N utilization were compromised when the diets of high-yielding dairy cows were supplemented with urea rather than true protein and the value of the true proteins.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of feeding calf starter on rumen pH of dairy calves during weaning transition. Twenty Holstein bull calves were paired into 10 blocks by starting date of the study and body weight, and fed either milk replacer and hay (MR) or MR, hay, and a commercial texturized calf starter (MR+S) in a randomized complete block design. All calves were fed 750 g/d of milk replacer as the basal diet. Calves on MR+S treatment were also fed a calf starter ad libitum to maintain similar energy intake between calves within blocks, and MR calves were fed additional milk replacer that was equivalent to energy from calf starter intake. When MR+S calves consumed a calf starter at 680 g/d for 3 consecutive d, rumen pH of a MR+S calf and his MR counterpart was measured continuously for 3 d using a small ruminant rumen pH measurement system. Treatment did not affect minimum pH, mean pH, maximum pH, standard deviation of mean pH, and duration or area under pH 5.8, indicating that calf starter consumption did not appear to affect rumen pH. However, hay intake was negatively correlated to area under pH 5.8, with a breakpoint at 0.080 kg/d intake, suggesting hay intake might play an important role in mitigating ruminal acidosis in dairy calves during weaning transition.},

Feed intake and average daily gain did not differ among treatment groups. Plasma pH and Ca were unaffected by dietary Ca content or dietary cation-anion difference. Plasma Cl and P decreased linearly with increasing Ca content in the diet. Plasma HCO3 increased linearly with increased dietary Ca content. Plasma HCO3 and partial pressure of CO2 were higher in calves fed the 200 compared with calves fed the 0 cation-anion difference diets. Plasma Cl was, however, lower in calves fed the 200 compared with calves fed the 0 meq diets. An interaction of Ca content and dietary cation-anion difference was detected for plasma P content. Urinary pH increased linearly with increasing dietary Ca content. Calves fed the 200 meq dietary cation-anion difference had higher urinary pH values than those fed the 0 meq diet. Urinary P excretion was not altered by dietary cation-anion difference or Ca content of the diet. Calves fed the 0 meq diet had higher urinary cocnentrations of Ca and Cl when compared with those fed the 200 meq diet. Bone ash, P, Ca, Mg, and K content of the 10th rib were not affected by dietary treatments. Breaking strength of the seventh and ninth ribs increased quadratically with increasing dietary Ca content. Dietary cation-anion difference had no effect on the breaking strength of the seventh and ninth ribs. Varying the dietary cation-anion difference from 0 to 200 meq/kg of dietary dry matter had no effect on Ca requirement of the growing calf.},

Blood was sampled on d 0, 1, and 3 postpartum for assessment of neutrophil phagocytic and oxidative burst activities. Blood was also sampled at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 12 DIM for determination of serum concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, nonesterified fatty acids, $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, and glucose. On the basis of receiver operator characteristic curves, subclinical hypocalcemia (SCH) was defined as a serum Ca concentration ≤8.59 mg/dL in at least 1 sample in the first 3 DIM. The overall incidences of metritis and puerperal metritis were 47.3 and 30{\%}, respectively. Concentration in blood and percentages of neutrophils undergoing phagocytosis and oxidative burst were all reduced in cows with SCH compared with normocalcemic cows. Cows with SCH were at a greater risk of developing fever, metritis, and puerperal metritis compared with normocalcemic cows. Among cows at low risk of developing metritis, those with SCH had a greater incidence of metritis (40.7{\%}) compared with normocalcemic cows (14.3{\%}). Similarly, among cows at high risk of developing metritis, cows with SCH had a greater incidence of metritis (77.8{\%}) compared with normocalcemic cows (20.0{\%}). Cows with SCH had elevated concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate compared with normocalcemic cows. The relative risk of developing metritis decreased by 22{\%} for every 1 mg/dL increase in serum Ca. Neither metritis nor SCH influenced the resumption of estrous cyclicity by 38 DIM, but cows with SCH had a reduced pregnancy rate and a longer interval to pregnancy compared with normocalcemic cows. Finally, the population risk to develop uterine diseases attributable to SCH was 66.6{\%} for metritis and 91.3{\%} for puerperal metritis in the present study.},

@article{Reynolds2008,
abstract = {The extensive development of the ruminant forestomach sets apart their N economy from that of nonruminants in a number of respects. Extensive pregastric fermentation alters the profile of protein reaching the small intestine, largely through the transformation of nitrogenous compounds into microbial protein. This process is fueled primarily by carbohydrate fermentation and includes extensive recycling of N between the body and gut lumen pools. Nitrogen recycling occurs via blood and gut lumen exchanges of urea and NH(3), as well as endogenous gut and secretory N entry into the gut lumen, and the subsequent digestion and absorption of microbial and endogenous protein. Factors controlling urea transfer to the gut from blood, including the contributions of urea transporters, remain equivocal. Ammonia produced by microbial degradation of urea and dietary and endogenous AA is utilized by microbial fermentation or absorbed and primarily converted to urea. Therefore, microbial growth and carbohydrate fermentation affect the extent of NH(3) absorption and urea N recycling and excretion. The extensive recycling of N to the rumen represents an evolutionary advantage of the ruminant in terms of absorbable protein supply during periods of dietary protein deficiency, or asynchronous carbohydrate and protein supply, but incurs a cost of greater N intakes, especially in terms of excess N excretion. Efforts to improve the efficiency of N utilization in ruminants by synchronizing fermentable energy and N availability have generally met with limited success with regards to production responses. In contrast, imposing asynchrony through oscillating dietary protein concentration, or infrequent supplementation, surprisingly has not negatively affected production responses unless the frequency of supplementation is less than once every 3 d. In some cases, oscillation of dietary protein concentration has improved N retention compared with animals fed an equal amount of dietary protein on a daily basis. This may reflect benefits of Orn cycle adaptations and sustained recycling of urea to the gut. The microbial symbiosis of the ruminant is inherently adaptable to asynchronous N and energy supply. Recycling of urea to the gut buffers the effect of irregular dietary N supply such that intuitive benefits of rumen synchrony in terms of the efficiency of N utilization are typically not observed in practice.},

abstract = {{\{}R{\}}ecent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense
marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers
feasible. {\{}H{\}}ere we attempted to estimate the effects of [{\~{}}]50,000
marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic
records. {\{}A{\}} genome of 1000 c{\{}M{\}} was simulated with a marker spacing
of 1 c{\{}M{\}}. {\{}T{\}}he markers surrounding every 1-c{\{}M{\}} region were combined
into marker haplotypes. {\{}D{\}}ue to finite population size ({\{}N{\}}e = 100),
the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the {\{}QTL{\}}
located between the markers. {\{}U{\}}sing least squares, all haplotype
effects could not be estimated simultaneously. {\{}W{\}}hen only the biggest
effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of
predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals
was only 0.32. {\{}B{\}}est linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects
assumed equal variances associated to each 1-c{\{}M{\}} chromosomal segment,
which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far
from true. {\{}B{\}}ayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of
the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this
accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. {\{}I{\}}t was concluded
that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially
increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially
if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation
interval. },

abstract = {The major function of vitamin D in vertebrates is maintenance of calcium homeostasis, but vitamin D insufficiency has also been linked to an increased risk of hypertension, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Therefore, there is a growing awareness about vitamin D as a requirement for optimal health. Vitamin D3 is synthesized in the skin by a photochemical conversion of provitamin D3, but the necessary rays are only emitted all year round in places that lie below a 35° latitude. Unfortunately, very few food sources naturally contain vitamin D and the general population as a results fail to meet the requirements. Fish have the highest natural content of vitamin D expected to derive from an accumulation in the food chain originating from microalgae. Microalgae contain both vitamin D3 and provitamin D3, which suggests that vitamin D3 exist in the plant kingdom and vitamin D3 has also been identified in several plant species as a surprise to many. The term vitamin D also includes vitamin D2 that is produced in fungi and yeasts by UVB-exposure of provitamin D2. Small amounts can be found in plants contaminated with fungi and traditionally only vitamin D2 has been considered present in plants. This review summarizes the current knowledge on sterol biosynthesis leading to provitamin D. It also addresses the occurrence of vitamin D and its hydroxylated metabolites in higher plants and in algae and discusses limitations and advantages of analytical methods used in studies of vitamin D and related compounds including recent advances in analytical technologies. Finally, perspectives for a future production of vitamin D biofortified fruits, vegetables, and fish will be presented.},

abstract = {The lactating dairy cow is fairly inefficient at converting dietary nitrogen to milk protein. When cows are fed to National Research Council (NRC, 2001) requirements, they convert approximately 25 percent of dietary nitrogen to milk protein. There may be some inherent limitations to the efficiency that can be achieved by a ruminant; however, examination of the NRC model with respect to available data suggests several areas where requirement or supply predictions could be improved. Ruminally degradable protein requirements appear to be too high. Reducing these requirements would allow reductions in dietary protein and improved animal efficiency. Amino acid (AA) flow to the small intestine appears to be predicted with good accuracy, provided diets are within current NRC requirements for ruminally degradable protein. Absorption of AA from the gut lumen is not constant across AA within an ingredient or across ingredients as assumed by NRC. Thus, absorbed AA may be predicted with bias. The gut tissues as represented in the portal-drained viscera and the liver remove approximately two-thirds of the available AA on a daily basis, and this removal is dependent on supply. Variable use by these maintenance tissues violates the NRC assumption of fixed maintenance use and introduces a significant bias in our current predictions. Mammary AA removal is highly regulated and counters supply (i.e., as supply declines transport activity increases and vice versa). Variable transport activity with respect to AA supply violates the NRC assumption of fixed conversion efficiencies for absorbed AA and introduces bias into predictions. Thus, our ability to successfully balance diets for adequate AA while minimizing dietary nitrogen inputs is currently hampered by a lack of data with respect to AA digestibility in the small intestine and poor representations of postabsorptive use of AA. Amino acid digestibility coefficients for individual ingredients are needed to address the first challenge, and an alternate representation of postabsorptive use and recycling of AA is required to address the second challenge.},

abstract = {A randomized, controlled field trial with dairy cows demonstrated an adverse effect of vitamin E supplementation during the dry period on mastitis incidence in early lactation. This study was conducted on farms with historically high rates of mastitis to investigate the benefit of vitamin E supplementation on udder health; however, the outcome showed an adverse effect. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether daily supplementation of 3,000 IU of vitamin E to dairy cows during the dry period could improve udder health in commercial herds with a high incidence of mastitis. On 5 dairy farms, dry cows were randomly divided into 2 experimental groups: a high and a low group. Both groups received a dry cow mineral mix providing 3,000 or 135 IU of vitamin E/cow per day, respectively, between dry-off and calving for a mean period of 8 wk. Providing 3,000 IU of vitamin E exceeds NRC standards, but this amount has been used in previous studies. The experiment, as well as the majority of the statistical analysis, were carried out blinded. Blood was sampled 3 times before calving and on calving day. Serum was analyzed for vitamin E and cholesterol. Vitamin E and the vitamin E:cholesterol ratio were analyzed as dependent variables in mixed models and Student's t-tests to study trends in time and differences between groups. Relative risk calculation and survival analysis were used to study the effect of supplementation on mastitis incidence in the first 3 mo of lactation. The results showed that vitamin E supplements increased both absolute vitamin E and the ratio of vitamin E to cholesterol in blood. In the high group, significantly more subclinical and clinical cases occurred, showing the same trend on all farms. In this study, an initial vitamin E level at dry off above 14.5 $\mu$mol/L was a risk factor for clinical mastitis, suggesting that the vitamin E status at the start of the dry period is important. It is recommended to work out exactly at what threshold vitamin E is harmful for udder health before new trials with high dosages of vitamin E are started. Additionally, further research is required to investigate the mechanism by which vitamin E affects udder health.},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of feeding rumen-protected choline (RPC) to dairy cows on the incidence of disease in early lactation, and on their fertility as measured by return to ovarian cyclicity and pregnancies per insemination (P/AI). In the first experiment, 369 cows were fed 15 g/day of RPC between 25 days pre-calving and 80 days post calving. In the second experiment, 578 primigravid cows were fed 15 g/day of RPC for the last 21 days of gestation only. In both experiments, P/AI were evaluated for the first and second inseminations, and health disorders were monitored daily until 90 days after calving. Return to cyclicity was evaluated in experiment 1 only, on days 51 and 61 post calving. In the first experiment, feeding RPC reduced the incidence of clinical ketosis, mastitis, and morbidity, and the number of cases of mastitis per cow. Feeding RPC did not influence cyclicity and P/AI. In the second experiment, cows fed RPC tended to have greater morbidity than controls because of an increased incidence of metritis and fever, although the incidence of retained fetal membranes was lower. The P/AI for first and second inseminations were similar between treatments. Supplementing the diets of dairy cattle with RPC from before until after calving improved the health of early lactation cows. However, in primigravid cows feeding RPC before calving only had mixed effects on health. Feeding RPC had no beneficial effects on reproduction in either experiment.},

Sixteen Danish Holstein cows (557 ± 37 kg of body weight, 120 ± 21 d in milk, mean ± SD), 8 fitted with ruminal cannulas, were used in a completely randomized block experiment. Treatments differed in forage type (corn silage vs. grass silage) and forage:concentrate ratio (50:50 vs. 75:25 on organic matter basis). Fiber passage kinetics were studied based on rumen evacuations and on marker excretion profiles in feces fitted to 1 and 2 pool models. Each cow received ytterbium (Yb)-labeled fiber of the forage fed in the ration, samarium (Sm)-labeled fiber of the forage not fed in the ration, and concentrate fiber labeled with lanthanum (La), all as a single pulse dose. Nineteen fecal grab samples were taken per cow. Rumen liquid passage was studied using chromium-EDTA dosed as a single pulse into the rumen, followed by sampling of rumen liquid from both the ventral and medial rumen. Rumen mean retention time did not differ between forages when based on Yb-excretion profiles but was numerically longer for grass silage- than for corn silage-based rations using rumen evacuation data. Liquid rate of passage did not differ when calculated from medial or ventral rumen liquid samples, indicating that estimates for the probability of rumen liquid escape were independent of rumen sampling site. Total mean retention time decreased from forage fiber to concentrate fiber to liquid. The forage type itself (corn silage or grass silage) rather than the ration composition seemed to determine the total-tract retention time of forage fiber.},

In the first experiment, shredded barley straw was treated with urea (60 g kg-1 DM) at 300 and 400 g moisture kg-1 in laboratory silos. They were stored in incubator at 26 ??C for 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. This was used to estimate the extent of urea hydrolysis and nitrogen retention. The second experiment measured the outflow rate of ammonia by blowing in air through treated straw into dilute H2SO4. The third experiment assessed the ability of grass and citrus pulp silages in holding ammonia. Urea hydrolysis was extensive (90-100{\%}) but independent of moisture and treatment period (P {\textgreater} 0.05). About 74{\%} of nitrogen added in the form of urea in treated straw was lost during aeration. Fermentation enhanced the ammonia holding capacity of citrus pulp. This was further improved with time and addition of molasses. It's nitrogen content was increased from 11.7 to 21.2 g kg-1 DM. This decreased to 16.0 g kg-1 DM about 5 h after gassing. Improvement in the nitrogen content of feeds with gassing suggest that dry matter and nitrogen intake by ruminants can be enhanced. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {{\{}S{\}}tearoyl-{\{}C{\}}o{\{}A{\}} desaturase ({\{}SCD{\}}) is an important enzyme in the
bovine mammary gland, and it introduces a double bond at the [{\{}D{\}}elta]9
location of primarily myristoyl-, palmitoyl-, and stearoyl-{\{}C{\}}o{\{}A{\}}.
{\{}T{\}}he main objective of this study was to compare the effects of
various fatty acids ({\{}FA{\}}) typically present in dairy cow rations
on the expression of {\{}SCD{\}}1 and {\{}SCD{\}}5 in the mammary gland of dairy
cows. {\{}T{\}}wenty-eight {\{}H{\}}olstein-{\{}F{\}}riesian cows were randomly assigned
to 1 of 4 dietary treatments. {\{}T{\}}he dietary treatments were a basal
diet supplemented (dry matter basis) with 2.7{\%} rapeseed oil as a
source of {\{}C{\}}18:1 cis-9; 2.7{\%} soybean oil as a source of {\{}C{\}}18:2
cis-9,12; 2.7{\%} linseed oil as a source of {\{}C{\}}18:3 cis-9,12,15; or
2.7{\%} of a 1:1:1 mixture of the 3 oils. {\{}T{\}}he oil supplements were
included in the concentrate, which was fed together with corn silage
and grass silage. {\{}I{\}}n addition, cows were grazing on pasture, consisting
mainly of perennial ryegrass, during the day. {\{}B{\}}iopsies from the
mammary gland were taken and analyzed for m{\{}RNA{\}} expression of {\{}SCD{\}}1
and {\{}SCD{\}}5 by using quantitative real-time {\{}PCR{\}}. {\{}M{\}}ilk yield as
well as milk protein and fat contents did not differ among the 4
dietary treatments. {\{}D{\}}ietary supplementation with rapeseed oil and
linseed oil increased proportions of {\{}C{\}}18:1 cis-9 and {\{}C{\}}18:3 cis-9,12,15
in blood plasma, respectively, compared with the other treatments.
{\{}S{\}}upplementation with soybean oil and linseed oil increased milk
{\{}FA{\}} proportions of {\{}C{\}}18:2 cis-9,12 and {\{}C{\}}18:3 cis-9,12,15, respectively,
but supplementation with rapeseed oil did not increase {\{}C{\}}18:1 cis-9
in milk. {\{}M{\}}ammary {\{}SCD{\}}1 expression was reduced by supplementation
of soybean oil compared with rapeseed oil and linseed oil. {\{}I{\}}n contrast,
{\{}SCD{\}}5 expression did not differ among the 4 treatments. {\{}T{\}}he {\{}C{\}}16
and {\{}C{\}}18 desaturation indices, representing proxies for {\{}SCD{\}} activity,
were lower for the soybean oil diet compared with the diet supplemented
with a mixture of the 3 oils. {\{}I{\}}n conclusion, our study shows that
mammary {\{}SCD{\}}1 expression is significantly downregulated in dairy
cows by feeding unprotected soybean oil compared with rapeseed oil
or linseed oil, and this is partially reflected by the lower desaturase
indices in the milk. {\{}F{\}}urthermore, mammary {\{}SCD{\}}5 expression appears
to be differently regulated than expression of {\{}SCD{\}}1.},

abstract = {{\{}I{\}}mprinted genes have been associated with a wide range of diseases.
{\{}M{\}}any of these diseases have symptoms that can be understood in
the context of the evolutionary forces that favored imprinted expression
at these loci. {\{}M{\}}odulation of perinatal growth and resource acquisition
has played a central role in the evolution of imprinting and many
of the diseases associated with imprinted genes involve some sort
of growth or feeding disorder. {\{}I{\}}n the first part of this chapter,
we discuss the relationship between the evolution of imprinting and
the clinical manifestations of imprinting-associated diseases. {\{}I{\}}n
the second half, we consider the variety of processes that can disrupt
imprinted gene expression and function. {\{}W{\}}e ask specifically if
there is reason to believe that imprinted genes are particularly
susceptible to deregulation and whether a disruption of an imprinted
gene is more likely to have deleterious consequences than a disruption
of an unimprinted gene. {\{}T{\}}here is more to a gene than its {\{}DNA{\}}
sequence. {\{}C{\}}. {\{}H{\}}. {\{}W{\}}addington used the term epigenetics to describe
biological differences between tissues that result from the process
of development 1 , 2 . {\{}W{\}}addington needed a new term to describe
this variation which was neither the result, of genotypic differences
between the cells nor well described as phenotypic variation. {\{}W{\}}e
now understand that heritable modifications of the {\{}DNA{\}} such as
cytosine methylation—and aspects of chromatin structure—including
histone modifications—are the mechanisms underlying what {\{}W{\}}addington
called the epigenotype. {\{}E{\}}pigenetic modifications are established
in particular cell lines during development and are responsible for
the patterns of gene expression seen in different tissue types. {\{}I{\}}n
contemporary usage, the term epigenetic refers to heritable changes
in gene expression that are not coded in the {\{}DNA{\}} sequence itself
3 . {\{}I{\}}n recent years, much attention has been paid to a particular
type of epigenetic variation: genomic imprinting. {\{}I{\}}n the case of
imprinting, the maternally and paternally inherited genes within
a single cell have epigenetic differences that result in divergent
patterns of gene expression 4 . {\{}I{\}}n the simplest scenario, only
one of the two alleles at an imprinted locus is expressed. {\{}I{\}}n other
cases, an imprinted locus can include a variety of maternally expressed,
paternally expressed and biallelically expressed transcripts 5 –
10 . {\{}S{\}}ome of these transcripts produce different proteins through
alternate splicing, while others produce noncoding {\{}RNA{\}} transcripts
. {\{}G{\}}enomic imprinting can also interact with the epigenotype in
{\{}W{\}}addington's sense: many genes are imprinted in a tissue-specific
manner, with monoallelic, expression in some cell types and biallelic
expression in others. {\{}O{\}}ther chapters in this volume cover our current
understanding of the mechanisms of imprinting, the phenotypic effects
of imprinted genes in mammals and what we know about imprinting in
plants. {\{}I{\}}n this chapter we discuss the link between imprinted genes
and human disease. {\{}F{\}}irst, we consider the phenotypes associated
with imprinted genes and ask whether the disorders associated with
these genes share a common motif. {\{}S{\}}econd, we consider the nature
and frequency of mutations of imprinted genes. {\{}W{\}}e ask whether we
should expect that imprinted genes are particularly fragile. {\{}T{\}}hat
is, are they more likely to undergo mutation and/or are mutations
of imprinted genes particularly likely to result in human disease?
{\{}I{\}}n general we consider how the field of evolutionary medicine the
use of evolution to understand why our body's design allows for the
existence of disease at all might contribute to our comprehension
of disorders linked to genomic imprinting.},

abstract = {Dietary sources of fatty acids were evaluated for their influence on oocyte quality and follicular development using 54 lactating cows in summer. Fat supplements were 1) sunflower oil (80{\%} cis 18:1), 2) Ca salt of transoctadecenoic acids (57{\%} trans 18:1), 3) Ca salt of vegetable oils (30{\%} 18:2), and 4) linseed oil (56{\%} 18:3 and 16{\%} 18:2). Fats were fed at 1.35{\%} of dietary dry matter beginning at 5 wk prior to expected calving date and at 1.5{\%} (oils) and 1.75{\%} (Ca salts) of dietary dry matter for 15 wk after parturition. Four days following a programmed induced ovulation, 5 transvaginal oocyte aspirations were performed 3 or 4 d apart. Three days after the last aspiration, PGF2alpha was injected, followed 3 d later by a GnRH injection and a timed artificial insemination (d 0) 16 to 20 h later. For the first 4 aspirations, oocytes grading 1 or 2 were used for in vitro embryo production. Total cell number and the proportion of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive blastomeres were analyzed at d 8. At the fifth aspiration, the occurrence of metaphase II, group II caspase activity, and TUNEL labeling were determined after oocyte maturation. A total of 1,011 oocytes were collected. The proportion of oocytes with high caspase activity was greater for grade 3 compared with grades 1 and 2 (37.5 vs. 1.54 and 1.61{\%}). Feeding polyunsaturated fatty acids, as compared with monosaturated fatty acids, failed to affect oocyte quality, as demonstrated by subsequent embryo development. Cows fed 18:2- or 18:3-enriched diets had a larger preovulatory follicle at insemination and subsequent volume of the corpus luteum compared with those fed cis 18:1 or trans 18:1 diets (16.8, 16.2 vs. 15.0, 14.9 +/- 0.7 mm; 7,323, 8,208 vs. 6,033, 5,495 +/- 644 mm3, respectively). The previously documented benefits of polyunsaturated fatty acids on reproductive performance appear to reflect actions at alternative biological windows in lactating dairy cows.},

abstract = {Buckwheat is of high value in crop rotations and overall agricultural ecology because of strong rooting and intensive flowering properties, but it is rarely cultivated and information on its nutritional value to ruminants is scarce. The contents of net energy for lactation (NEL), as estimated with the Hohenheim Gas Test (n = 3), were 4.3, 4.9 and 7.5 MJ NEL/kg dry matter (DM) for fresh and ensiled whole buckwheat plants and buckwheat grain, respectively. In two experiments with the Rumen Simulation Technique (Rusitec), ruminal fermentation characteristics of buckwheat forages and buckwheat grain (n = 4/diet) were evaluated. In the first experiment, 0, 300 or 600 g/kg of a pure hay diet were replaced by either fresh or ensiled buckwheat to create five diets. Neither form of buckwheat forages had effects on in vitro ruminal degradability and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations and composition. The use of fresh buckwheat reduced ruminal ammonia concentrations and enhanced estimated microbial N growth efficiency. These differences did not occur with silage, indicating a change in nutritional value by ensiling. Fresh buckwheat reduced the number of bacteria in the incubated fluid, while ensiled buckwheat reduced that of holotrich protozoa. Methane formation was not influenced by the buckwheat forages. In the second experiment, wheat meal (400 g/kg dietary DM), was replaced stepwise (0.5 and 1.0) by buckwheat grain meal. This did not cause differences in parameters of nutrient degradability, relative N efficiency and total amount and composition of SCFA. Holotrich protozoa counts increased, but total gas formation decreased with increasing dietary level of buckwheat grain. In a final experiment, cows yielding about 40 kg milk/day were fed mixed silage-concentrate diets (n = 4). A control diet contained no buckwheat. In a second diet, maize silage was partly substituted by buckwheat silage (98 g/kg dietary DM). In a third group, part of the energy concentrate was substituted by buckwheat grain meal (94 g/kg). There were no effects on feed intake, milk yield and milk composition. Buckwheat proved to be a plant that offers different feeds of a quality sufficient to be considered suitable in ruminant nutrition. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Sixty-four primigravid heifers (56 Holstein and 8 Jersey) and 80 multiparous cows (64 Holstein and 16 Jersey) were used. A combination of vitamin E or Zn and Fe was fed in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement during the last 42 d prepartum. Amounts of supplements per animal were 1000 IU of vitamin E (d, l alpha-tocopheryl acetate), 0.8 g of Zn (Zn-Met and ZnSO4), and 12 g of Fe (FeSO4.7H2O) for Holsteins and 9 g for Jerseys. Neither vitamin E nor Zn directly affected the incidence of retained fetal membranes, but plasma alpha-tocopherol was lower when fetal membranes were retained {\textgreater} 12 h or when vitamin E was not supplemented. Iron had no direct negative effects on reproductive performance, but cows receiving additional Fe had lower unsaturated iron-binding capacity, which, in turn, was also lower in cows that retained fetal membranes. Days to first observed estrus were reduced by supplementation with either vitamin E or Zn. Vitamin E reduced days to first artificial insemination (AI) and tended to reduce days open. Supplemental Zn tended to reduce days to first AI but did not affect days open. Milk production during the first 12 wk and AI per conception were not affected by supplementation with either vitamin E or Zn. Both vitamin E and Zn reduced days to first observed estrus, indicating improved reproductive health during the early postpartum period.},

abstract = {The present study was investigated whether increasing amounts of glucose supply have a stimulatory effect on the mRNA abundance and activity of key lipogenic enzymes in adipose tissue of midlactation dairy cows. Twelve Holstein-Friesian dairy cows in midlactation were cannulated in the jugular vein and infused with either a 40{\%} glucose solution (n=6) or saline (n=6). For glucose infusion cows, the infusion dose increased by 1.25{\%}/d relative to the initial net energy for lactation (NEL) requirement until a maximum dose equating to a surplus of 30{\%} NEL was reached on d 24. This maximum dose was maintained until d 28 and stopped thereafter (between d 29-32). Cows in the saline infusion group received an equivalent volume of 0.9{\%} saline solution. Samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue were taken on d 0, 8, 16, 24, and 32 when surplus glucose reached 0, 10, 20, and 30{\%} of the NEL requirement, respectively. The mRNA abundance of fatty acid synthase, cytoplasmic acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, cytoplasmic glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-1, and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase showed linear treatment × dose interactions with increasing mRNA abundance with increasing glucose dose. The increased mRNA abundance was paralleled by a linear treatment × dose interaction for fatty acid synthase and acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase enzymatic activities. The mRNA abundance of ATP-citrate lyase showed a tendency for linear treatment × dose interaction with increasing mRNA abundance with increasing glucose dose. The mRNA abundance of all tested enzymes, as well as the activities of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, correlated with plasma glucose and serum insulin levels. In a multiple regression model, the predictive value of insulin was dominant over that of glucose. In conclusion, gradual increases in glucose supply upregulate key lipogenic enzymes in adipose tissue of midlactating dairy cows with linear dose dependency. Insulin appears to be critically involved in this regulation.},

abstract = {Efficiency of genomic selection with low-cost genotyping in a composite line from a cross between inbred lines was evaluated for a trait with heritability 0.10 or 0.25 using a low-density marker map. With genomic selection, selection was on the sum of estimates of effects of all marker intervals across the genome, fitted either as fixed (fixed GS) or random (random GS) effects. Reponses to selection over 10 generations, starting from the F(2), were compared with standard BLUP selection. Estimates of variance for each interval were assumed independent and equal. Both GS strategies outperformed BLUP selection, especially in initial generations. Random GS outperformed fixed GS in early generations and performed slightly better than fixed GS in later generations. Random GS gave higher genetic gain when the number of marker intervals was greater (180 or 10 cM intervals), whereas fixed GS gave higher genetic gain when the number of marker intervals was low (90 or 20 cM). Including interactions between generation and marker scores in the model resulted in lower genetic gains than models without interactions. When phenotypes were available only in the F(2) for GS, treating marker scores as fixed effects led to considerably lower genetic gain than random GS. Benefits of GS over standard BLUP were lower with high heritability. Genomic selection resulted in greater response than MAS based on only significant marker intervals (standard MAS) by increasing the frequency of QTL with both large and small effects. The efficiency of genomic selection over standard MAS depends on stringency of the threshold used for QTL detection. In conclusion, genomic selection can be effective in composite lines using a sparse marker map.},

abstract = {Miller-Cushon, E. K. and DeVries, T. J. 2015. Invited review: Development and expression of dairy calf feeding behaviour. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 95: 341{\'{A}}350. Feeding and housing practices for dairy calves impact performance and growth early in life, as well as feeding behaviour. There is also increasing evidence that early exposure to different feeding and housing strategies influence the development of feeding behaviour. The dairy calf needs access to milk in sufficient quantities to maintain health and high-levels of growth. In addition, intake of solid feed, such as grain concentrate, is necessary early in life to establish fermentation and develop the rumen. In dairy calves, feeding behaviour patterns can have direct impact on nutrient consumption and, consequently, growth. Further, recent research has provided evidence that behaviour patterns that develop in response to management factors early in life may persist once learned, potentially having longer-term implications for health and welfare. Thus, there is potential for various nutritional, housing, and management factors to impact the learning of feeding behaviour early in the life of dairy calves. This review provides several examples of early management factors that influence feeding behaviour of dairy calves and, in turn, impact calf growth and welfare. For example, providing continuous, ad libitum access to milk results not only in greater growth, but also in meal patterns that more closely resemble the natural behaviour of a calf suckling its dam. Housing management also has the potential to influence when, and how much, a calf eats. Whereas social facilitation promotes intake, particularly at weaning, competition for feed in group-housed calves restricts feeding patterns and degree of feeding synchrony. With regards to provision of solid feed, recent data suggest that providing physically effective hay, in addition to grain concentrate, may be beneficial for the rumen environment and consequent growth and efficiency. However, the physical form and presentation of forage may also influence feeding behaviour of calves, in particular feed sorting, which can impact both immediate nutrient intakes as well as the development and persistence of that behaviour. For example, calves provided hay and concentrate as a mixture begin to sort their feed early in life, with the pattern of sorting depending on hay particle size. Feed sorting in young calves may reflect a motivation to consume a proportion of hay in the diet. In general, it appears to be beneficial for early growth and welfare to support milk and solid feed intake through unrestricted allowances and less-competitive feeding environments. Continued research in this area is needed to assess the longevity of learned behaviour patterns, and what factors may influence their persistence.},

abstract = {Abstract—Protein quality of soybean meal (SBM) is linked to both the reduction of anti-nutritional factors (ANFs), and the optimization of protein digestibility. Inadequate heating fails to completely destroy the ANFs. Excessive heating reduces the availability of lysine via the Maillard reaction and possibly, to a lesser extent, other amino acids, and decreases the protein nutritive quality. The objective of the study was the analysis of some chemical indices for determining SBM quality, and their correlation with biophysical indices. The experimental data revealed that urease index (UI) is useful to determine if the soybean meal has been heated enough to reduce ANFs, but it is not useful to determine excessive heat treatment. KOH solubility is a good index for determining over processing, but it is not a sensitive index for monitoring under processing of soybean meal. Combing protein dispersibility index (PDI) and UI could be useful to monitor soybean quality. The investigated biophysical indices are positively correlated with PDI: r = 0.9477 (p{\textless}0.01) for refractive index, and r=0.9406 (p{\textless}0.01) for dynamic viscosity. The biophysical methods have the advantage to be very rapid and nonpolluting since they don't use chemical reagents.},

@article{Egger-Danner2012,
abstract = {A complex deterministic approach was used to model the breeding goal and breeding structure for the Austrian Fleckvieh (dual-purpose Simmental) breed. The reference breeding goal corresponded to the current total merit index (TMI-R), where dairy traits have a relative weight of 37.9{\%} and fitness traits of 43.7{\%} (beef traits 16.5{\%}; milkability 2{\%}). The breeding program was characterized by 280,000 cows under performance recording, 3,200 bull dams, 100 test bulls with a test capacity of 25{\%}, and 15 proven bulls and 8 bull sires per year. The annual monetary genetic gain (AMGG) was generated mainly by increases in milk fat and milk protein yield (80.6{\%}) and only to a small extent by fitness traits (6.6{\%}). The inclusion of direct health traits (early reproductive disorders, cystic ovaries, and mastitis) with their economic weights increased the relative AMGG for fitness traits from 6.6 to 11.2{\%}. The presently slightly negative AMGG for fertility index and udder health changed in a positive direction. Increasing the weight on the direct health traits by 50{\%} resulted in a further shift toward fitness and health. The effect of strategies using genomic information in a total merit index (TMI) with varying weights on fitness and health traits was also analyzed. The conventional progeny-testing scheme was defined as the reference breeding program. A breeding program was considered to be genomically enhanced (GS50) when 50{\%} of inseminations of herdbook cows and of bull dams were from young bulls with a genomic TMI, and a second program (GS100) did not rely on progeny-tested bulls at all. For GS50, a clear shift of the relative gain in AMGG toward fitness and health traits was observed for all 3 TMI scenarios, as a result of larger progeny groups and a shorter generation interval. For GS100, where no gene flow from progeny-tested bulls was assumed, the genetic gain per generation was lower for the fertility and udder health index but higher per year. The results based on natural genetic gain per year showed that no positive genetic response for fertility and udder health index were achieved for TMI-R (without the inclusion of direct health traits) in GS50 and GS100. The direction of the genetic trend was determined by the weights given to fertility and udder health indices within the TMI. When appropriate weights generated a clear positive trend, GS50 and GS100 reinforced this trend.},

abstract = {The purpose was to determine the association of milk California Mastitis Test (CMT), somatic cell concentration (SCC), and milk differential cell count results on day 3 postcalving with subsequent lactation production and health events. On d 3 postcalving, the CMT was performed and quarter milk samples were collected from 130 dairy cows. Quarter SCC and milk differential cell counts were determined. Microbiology on duplicate quarter milk samples was used to determine the presence of intramammary infection by major or minor pathogens. Production measures obtained using Dairy Herd Improvement Association testing were 150-d standardized and summit milks. Milk culture results on a cow basis included 82 (63.1{\%}) samples with no growth, 31 (23.9{\%}) with major pathogens, and 17 (13.1{\%}) with minor pathogens. Milk culture results comparing cows with no growth to those with any growth (major or minor pathogens) were not associated with statistically significant differences in milk production. Milk culture results comparing cows with major pathogens to those with no growth and minor pathogens combined were associated with statistically significant differences in 150 d milk. Milk production did not differ for cows with CMT results above and below a cut-off of trace, and for SCC results above and below cut-offs of 200,000, 300,000, and 400,000/mL, respectively. Statistically significant differences in milk production were found for cows above and below cut-offs for percentage neutrophils in milk and for absolute neutrophil counts. Associations were found for milk production and number of quarters (0, 1, 2, or 3 and 4 combined) above respective cut-offs for SCC, percentage neutrophils in milk, and absolute numbers of neutrophils in milk, but not for CMT. Milk production differed for cows experiencing any health event versus those with no health event. The most commonly recorded health event was clinical mastitis. Statistically significant associations were detected between health events and milk culture results, SCC, neutrophil percentage, and neutrophil absolute counts. Results of the present investigation indicate that milk monitoring on d 3 of lactation using milk neutrophil percentage or neutrophil absolute counts may be useful as an indication of subsequent milk production.},

abstract = {The objectives of this experiment were to determine the speed at which cows that had their estrous cycle presynchronized with a GnRH or PGF(2$\alpha$) injection are reinseminated and become pregnant. Furthermore, this experiment aimed to determine whether treatment with a controlled internal drug-releasing (CIDR) insert during the timed artificial insemination (AI) protocol improves pregnancy per AI (P/AI) of cows that had their estrous cycle presynchronized with GnRH or PGF(2$\alpha$). Lactating cows from 2 herds were assigned to 1 of 2 presynchronization treatments at 32 ± 4 d after AI: GGPG (n=452)--GnRH injection at enrollment (d 0), 7d before the start of the timed AI protocol, and P11GPG (n=466)--PGF(2$\alpha$) injection on d 3, 11 d before the start of the timed AI protocol. Cows observed in estrus at any interval after enrollment were reinseminated on the same day. Cows not observed in estrus by d 7 were paired by presynchronization treatment and assigned to receive or not receive a CIDR insert during the timed AI protocol (CIDR = 240, no CIDR = 317). Timed AI protocols were the Ovsynch56 at site A and the Cosynch48 at site B. A subsample of cows from site A had their ovaries scanned by ultrasound at enrollment and on the day of the first GnRH and PGF(2$\alpha$) injections of the timed AI protocol and had blood sampled at each injection of the timed AI protocol for determination of progesterone concentration. Cows were examined for pregnancy 32 ± 4 and 67 ± 4 d after reinsemination. Cows in the P11GPG treatment had a faster reinsemination rate [adjusted hazard ratio = 1.24 (95{\%} CI = 1.07, 1.45)] and were less likely to be submitted to the timed AI protocol (40.3 vs. 89.8{\%}) and to be reinseminated at a fixed time (38.6 vs. 83.9{\%}). The interval from enrollment to reinsemination was shorter for cows in the P11GPG group (13.0 ± 0.4 vs. 15.0 ± 0.2d). Presynchronization treatment did not affect P/AI 32 ± 4 d (GGPG = 42.3{\%}, P11GPG = 39.3{\%}) and 67 ± 4 d (GGPG = 37.0{\%}, P11GPG = 35.4{\%}) after reinsemination. Pregnancy rate from d 0 to 7 (GGPG = 3.6{\%}, P11GPG = 17.7{\%}) and from d 8 to 14 (GGPG = 1.6{\%}, P11GPG = 5.7{\%}) were greater for cows in the P11GPG treatment. Treatment with the CIDR insert during the timed AI protocol did not affect P/AI 32 ± 4 d (CIDR = 41.7{\%}, no CIDR = 41.4{\%}) and 67 ± 4 d (CIDR = 36.5{\%}, no CIDR = 35.3{\%}) after reinsemination. A greater percentage of cows in the GGPG treatment had progesterone concentration ≥ 1 ng/mL on the day of the first GnRH injection of the timed AI protocol (83.8 vs. 51.5{\%}), but a greater percentage of cows in the P11GPG treatment ovulated in response to the first GnRH injection of the timed AI protocol (66.1 vs. 46.8{\%}). We conclude that the P/AI of cows that had their estrous cycle presynchronized with GnRH or PGF(2$\alpha$) was not different, but in herds with adequate estrous detection efficiency and accuracy, presynchronization with PGF(2$\alpha$) may reduce the interval to the establishment of pregnancy.},

abstract = {A genome scan was conducted on 370 F2 Duroc-Landrace pigs. Microsatellite markers (n = 182) were genotyped across the entire F2 population, all F1 parents and the paternal grandparents. Breed of origin of all chromosomal segments inherited in F2 progeny were predicted using GenoProb, where genotypic data, genetic maps and extended pedigrees were used as inputs. Statistical tests for quantitative trait loci (QTL) associations were conducted on 41 phenotypes with SAS using output from GenoProb for genotypic data. Fixed effects included sex and age at slaughter. For certain analyses carcass weight, RYR1 genotype and/or PRKAG3 genotype were also included as covariates. Subjective and objective measures of pork colour, marbling and tenderness were recorded, as well as measures of carcass fatness and muscularity. Test results were adjusted to a genome-wide level of significance. Five genomic regions presented significant evidence for QTL at chromosome 1 positions 6 cM (intramuscular fat) and 67 cM (Hunter L*), chromosome 2 position 62 cM (taste panel tenderness), chromosome 17 position 50 (loineye area and image analysis estimated loineye area) and X position 87 cM (carcass weight). Sixty-six suggestive associations were detected. Fourteen of these associations were within the regions with significant QTL on chromosomes 2, 17 and X, and the remaining 52 associations resided in 29 other regions on 13 different chromosomes of the porcine genome. The chromosome 2 region of 60-66 cM was associated with all measures of pork tenderness and the region on chromosome 17 (32-39 cM) was associated with both measures of intramuscular fat and loineye area. After verification, the QTL for marbling and tenderness should be useful in commercial production to improve pork quality as the population was developed from two of the three most utilized breeds of swine in the USA.},

abstract = {Forty-seven dairy herds (approximately 3,129 lactating cows) from northeast of Spain that were offering exactly the same lactating ration were surveyed to determine the effect of nondietary factors on herd performance. The survey collected information on the profile of the owners (their future intentions, the number of workers, and time devoted to the enterprise), information regarding the animals (reproductive performance, incidence of pathology, culling rate, etc.), information on the facilities (number of feeders, waters, stalls, cleanliness, etc.) and information on management practices (numbers of daily milkings, feed deliveries, feed push-ups, cleaning frequency, etc.). In addition, the chemical quality of drinking water from each dairy enterprise was determined. Also, amount of feed delivered to each herd, daily total milk production, and milk quality were obtained for each herd for a period of 8 mo before the fulfillment of the survey. Mortality rate of calves tended to be lesser in herds that weaned progressively than in those that weaned abruptly. Age at first calving was negatively correlated with level of milk production (mainly due to the type of heifer rearing system used). Culling rate tended to be lower in herds that used a close-up ration than in those that did not. Using gloves and paper towels (instead of cloth towels) tended to reduce the somatic cell count in milk. Concentration of calcium in the drinking water tended to be negatively correlated with the number of days open and with the proportion of cows culled due to infertility problems. Despite that the 47 herds fed the same ration and shared a similar genetic base, average milk production per cow ranged from 20.6 to 33.8 kg/d. A positive relationship (r = 0.57) between the number of stalls per cow and milk production was found. The most important nondietary factors that affected milk production in these dairy herds were age at first calving, presence or absence of feed refusals, number of free stalls per lactating cow, and whether feed was pushed up in the feed bunk. These factors accounted for more than 50{\%} of the observed variation, not attributable to the diet, in milk yield.},

abstract = {Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) increases lipopolysaccharide endotoxin in the rumen, which might translocate into the systemic circulation, triggering a cascade of clinical and immunological alterations. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical immune and metabolic responses to ruminal-derived lipopolysaccharide in nonlactating cows induced with SARA using 2 challenges, a grain-based SARA challenge (GBSC) or an alfalfa-pellet SARA challenge (APSC). Six dry, nonlactating Holstein cows were used in a 3 × 3 Latin square arrangement of treatments with 4-wk experimental cycles. All cows received the control diet containing 70{\%} forage and 30{\%} mixed concentrates (dry matter basis) for 3 wk. In wk 4, cows received a control diet, GBSC (38{\%} wheat-barley pellets, 32{\%} other mixed concentrate, and 30{\%} forages), or APSC (45{\%} mixed concentrate, 32{\%} alfalfa pellets, and 23{\%} other forages). Total plasma proteins and immunology-related proteins, acute phase proteins, blood cells, serum chemistry, mRNA gene expression of peripheral blood cell surface markers, and selected proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Ruminal pH was lower in both groups with induced SARA compared with a control group. Ruminal endotoxins were higher in GBSC; however, plasma endotoxin was not detected in any study group. No significant differences in feed intake, rectal temperature, white blood cell counts, or differentials were found between control and SARA challenge groups; changes in glucose, urea, Ca, and Mg were observed in SARA groups. Total plasma proteins were lower in both SARA groups, and acute phase proteins were higher in GBSC. The expression of CD14, MD2, and TLR4 mRNA in peripheral blood leukocytes was not affected by SARA induction. The induction of SARA as a result of GBSC or APSC challenge was successful; however, LPS was not detected in plasma. Changes in clinical, metabolic, and inflammatory responses were not observed in the SARA-challenged cows, suggesting that, in this study, SARA was not associated with a systemic response to inflammation.},

{\{}A{\}} tendency for greater total-tract digestibility of {\{}NDF{\}} and {\{}ADF{\}}

abstract = {Maternal effects can play an important role in a diversity of ecological and evolutionary processes such as population dynamics, phenotypic plasticity, niche construction, life-history evolution and the evolutionary response to selection. However, although maternal effects were defined by quantitative geneticists well over half a century ago, there remains some confusion over exactly what phenomena should be characterized as maternal effects and, more importantly, why it matters and how they are defined. We suggest a definition of maternal effects as the causal influence of the maternal genotype or phenotype on the offspring phenotype. This definition differs from some definitions in that it treats maternal effects as a phenomenon, not as a statistical construct. The causal link to maternal genotype or phenotype is the critical component of this definition providing the link between maternal effects and evolutionary and ecological processes. We show why phenomena such as maternal cytoplasmic inheritance and genomic imprinting are distinct genetically from and have different evolutionary consequences than true maternal effects. We also argue that one should consider cases where the maternal effect is conditional on offspring genotype as a class of maternal effects.},

abstract = {Previous research suggested that crude protein (CP) from canola meal (CM) was used more efficiently than CP from solvent soybean meal (SBM) by lactating dairy cows. We tested whether dietary CP content influenced relative effectiveness of equal supplemental CP from either CM or SBM. Fifty lactating Holstein cows were blocked by parity and days in milk into 10 squares (2 squares with ruminal cannulas) in a replicated 5×5 Latin square trial. Five squares were fed: (1) low (14.5-14.8{\%}) CP with SBM, (2) low CP with CM, (3) low CP with SBM plus CM, (4) high (16.4-16.7{\%}) CP with SBM, and (5) high CP with CM; the other 5 squares were fed the same diets except with rumen-protected Met plus Lys (RPML) added as Mepron (Degussa Corp., Kennesaw, GA) and AminoShure-L (Balchem Corp., New Hampton, NY), which were assumed to provide 8g/d of absorbed dl-Met and 12g/d of absorbed l-Lys. Diets contained [dry matter (DM) basis] 40{\%} corn silage, 26{\%} alfalfa silage, 14 to 23{\%} corn grain, 2.4{\%} mineral-vitamin premixes, and 29 to 33{\%} neutral detergent fiber. Periods were 3wk (total 15wk), and data from the last week of each period were analyzed using the Mixed procedures of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The only effects of RPML were increased DM intake and milk urea N (MUN) and urinary N excretion and trends for decreased milk lactose and solids-not-fat concentrations and milk-N:N intake; no significant RPML × protein source interactions were detected. Higher dietary CP increased milk fat yield and tended to increase milk yield but also elevated MUN, urine volume, urinary N excretion, ruminal concentrations of ammonia and branched-chain volatile fatty acids (VFA), lowered milk lactose concentration and milk-N:N intake, and had no effect on milk true protein yield. Feeding CM instead of SBM increased feed intake, yields of milk, energy-corrected milk, and true protein, and milk-N:N intake, tended to increase fat and lactose yields, and reduced MUN, urine volume, and urinary N excretion. At low CP, MUN was lower and intake tended to be greater on SBM plus CM versus SBM alone, but MUN and N excretion were not reduced to the same degree as on CM alone. Interactions of parity × protein source and parity × CP concentration indicated that primiparous cows were more responsive than multiparous cows to improved supply of metabolizable protein. Replacing SBM with CM reduced ruminal ammonia and branched-chain VFA concentrations, indicating lower ruminal degradation of CM protein. Replacing SBM with CM improved milk and protein yield and N-utilization in lactating cows fed both low- and high-CP diets.},

abstract = {Reactive oxygen metabolites generated during normal
metabolism and metabolism stimulated by xenobiotics
can enter into reactions that, when uncontrolled,
can impair performance of dairy cows. Direct effects
include peroxidative changes in membranes and other
cellular components. Indirectly, competitive
consumption of reducing equivalents can interfere
with important metabolic functions and divert
glucose from other pathways by inducing the
monophosphate shunt. Normally, the body is protected
by a wide range of antioxidant systems working in
concert. Metal catalysts of oxidative reactions are
removed in extracellular fluids by metal-binding
macromolecules. Superoxide dismutases, glutathione
peroxidase, and catalase within cells remove
superoxide and peroxides before they react with
metal catalysts to form more reactive
species. Finally, peroxidative chain reactions
initiated by reactive species that escaped enzymatic
degradation are terminated by chain-breaking
antioxidants, including water-soluble ascorbate,
glutathione, and urate and lipid-soluble vitamin E,
ubiquinone, and {\{}beta{\}}-carotene. To optimize
performance, oxidative stress in high producing cows
must be controlled by supplying all known
antioxidant nutrients and by minimizing effects of
substances that stimulate reactive oxygen
metabolites. },

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of chromium propionate (CrPr), rumen-protected lysine and methionine (RPLM), or both on metabolism, neutrophil function, and adipocyte size in lactating dairy cows (38±15d in milk). Forty-eight individually fed Holstein cows (21 primiparous, 27 multiparous) were stratified by calving date in 12 blocks and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments within block. Treatments were control, CrPr (8mg/d of Cr, KemTRACE brand chromium propionate 0.04{\%}, Kemin Industries Inc., Des Moines, IA), RPLM (10g/d lysine and 5g/d methionine intestinally available, from LysiPEARL and MetiPEARL, Kemin Industries Inc.), or CrPr plus RPLM. Treatments were fed for 35 d; blood plasma samples were collected ond 21 and 35 of treatment, and blood neutrophils were isolated from 24 cows for analysis of tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$) and interleukin 1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$) transcript abundance in the basal state and after 12h of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation. Tailhead subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were collected ond 35 for measurement of adipocyte size. Plasma glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, and glucagon concentrations were unaffected by treatments, whereas plasma insulin concentration was increased by RPLM. Basal TNF$\alpha$ transcript abundance in neutrophils was not affected by treatment, but basal IL-1$\beta$ transcript abundance was decreased by RPLM and tended to be increased by CrPr. After LPS activation, CrPr increased neutrophil TNF$\alpha$ transcript abundance. In addition, RPLM×parity interactions were detected for both TNF$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$ abundance after LPS activation, reflecting enhanced responses in primiparous cows and attenuated responses in multiparous cows supplemented with RPLM. Adipocyte size was not affected by treatment. Supplemental CrPr and RPLM had minimal effects on metabolism when fed for 35d near peak lactation but may modulate innate immune function in lactating dairy cows.},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The effects of a grain-based subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) challenge on translocation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the peripheral circulation, acute phase proteins in blood and milk, feed intake, milk production and composition, and blood metabolites were determined in 8 lactating Holstein cows. Between wk 1 and 5 of 2 successive 6-wk periods, cows received a total mixed ration ad libitum with a forage to concentrate (F:C) ratio of 50:50. In wk 6 of both periods, the SARA challenge was conducted by replacing 21{\%} of the dry matter of the total mixed ration with pellets containing 50{\%} wheat and 50{\%} barley. Rumen pH was monitored continuously using indwelling pH probes in 4 rumen cannulated cows. Rumen fluid samples were collected 15 min before feed delivery and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 24 h after feed delivery for 2 d during wk 5 (control) and wk 6 (SARA). Peripheral blood samples were collected using jugular catheters 15 min before feeding and at 6 and 12 h after feeding at the same days of the rumen fluid collections. The SARA challenge significantly reduced average daily pH from 6.17 to 5.97 and increased the duration of rumen pH below pH 5.6 from 118 to 279 min/d. The challenge reduced dry matter intake (16.5 vs. 19 kg/d), milk yield (28.3 vs. 31.6 kg/d), and milk fat (2.93 vs. 3.30{\%}, 0.85 vs. 0.97 kg/d), and tended to increase milk protein percentage (3.42 vs. 3.29{\%}), without affecting milk protein yield (1.00 vs. 0.98 kg/d). The challenge also increased the concentration of free LPS in rumen fluid from 28,184 to 107,152 endotoxin units (EU)/mL. This was accompanied by an increase in LPS in peripheral blood plasma (0.52 vs. {\textless}0.05 EU/mL) with a peak at 12 h after feeding (0.81 EU/mL). Concentrations of the acute phase proteins serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, and LPS-binding protein (LBP) in peripheral blood as well as LBP concentration in milk increased (438.5 vs. 167.4, 475.6 vs. 0, 53.1 vs. 18.2, and 6.94 vs. 3.02 {\{}micro{\}}g/mL, respectively) during SARA. The increase in LBP in combination with the increase in LPS in peripheral blood provides additional evidence of translocation of LPS. Results suggest that the grain-based SARA challenge resulted in translocation of LPS into the peripheral circulation, and that this translocation triggered a systemic inflammatory response.},

abstract = {Three cannulated, lactating cows were used in a 3 x 3 Latin square design to determine the effect of roasting or NaOH treatment of barley on ruminal fermentation and site and extent of digestion of nutrients. Experimental treatments were rolled barley, roasted (exit temperature, 135 degrees C) and rolled barley, and treated with 4{\%} NaOH and 220 L of H2O/tonne of barley. Diets also consisted of grass silage and soybean meal. Treatment with NaOH reduced concentrations of several AA, starch, and NDF in the barley. Starch digestibility in the rumen was lower for barley that was treated with NaOH but was unaffected for roasted barley. Digestibilities of N and starch in the small intestine were reduced for barley treated with NaOH, but values for rolled and roasted barley were similar. Apparent total tract digestibility of starch was reduced for the NaOH treated barley. Treatment of barley with NaOH tended to have a detrimental effect on feed intake, digestibility, and milk production. Roasting of barley did not appear to affect the site or extent of carbohydrate digestion, but roasting protected N from ruminal degradation. The protective effect on the carbohydrate fraction would be expected to be greater if the grain were cooled prior to rolling so that the protein matrix of the starch granule remained intact.},

abstract = {{\{}G{\}}enetic selection is a major force shaping life on earth. {\{}I{\}}n
classical genetic theory, response to selection is the product of
the strength of selection and the additive genetic variance in a
trait. {\{}T{\}}he additive genetic variance reflects a population's
intrinsic potential to respond to selection. {\{}T{\}}he ordinary additive
genetic variance, however, ignores the social organization of life.
{\{}W{\}}ith social interactions among individuals, individual trait values
may depend on genes in others, a phenomenon known as indirect genetic
effects. {\{}M{\}}odels accounting for indirect genetic effects, however,
lack a general definition of heritable variation. {\{}H{\}}ere {\{}I{\}} propose
a general definition of the heritable variation that determines the
potential of a population to respond to selection. {\{}T{\}}his generalizes
the concept of heritable variance to any inheritance model and level
of organization. {\{}T{\}}he result shows that heritable variance determining
potential response to selection is the variance among individuals
in the heritable quantity that determines the population mean trait
value, rather than the usual additive genetic component of phenotypic
variance. {\{}I{\}}t follows, therefore, that heritable variance may exceed
phenotypic variance among individuals, which is impossible in classical
theory. {\{}T{\}}his work also provides a measure of the utilization of
heritable variation for response to selection and integrates two
well-known models of maternal genetic effects. {\{}T{\}}he result shows
that relatedness between the focal individual and the individuals
affecting its fitness is a key determinant of the utilization of
heritable variance for response to selection.},

abstract = {Four ruminally cannulated, lactating Holstein cows were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design (28-d periods) with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments to study the effects of dietary addition of essential oils (0 vs. 2 g/d; EO) and monensin (0 vs. 350 mg/d; MO) on digestion, ruminal fermentation characteristics, milk production, and milk composition. Intake of dry matter averaged 22.7 kg/d and was not significantly affected by dietary additives. Apparent digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and starch were similar among treatments. Apparent digestibility of acid detergent fiber was increased when diets were supplemented with EO (48.9 vs. 46.0{\%}). Apparent digestibility of crude protein was higher for cows fed MO compared with those fed no MO (65.0 vs. 63.6{\%}). Nitrogen retention was not changed by additive treatments and averaged 27.1 g/d across treatments. Ruminal pH was increased with the addition of EO (6.50 vs. 6.39). Ruminal ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration was lower with MO-supplemented diets compared with diets without MO (12.7 vs. 14.3 mg/100 mL). No effect of EO and MO was observed on total volatile fatty acid concentrations and molar proportions of individual volatile fatty acids. Protozoa counts were not affected by EO and MO addition. Production of milk and 4{\%} fat-corrected milk was similar among treatments (33.6 and 33.4 kg/d, respectively). Milk fat content was lower for cows fed MO than for cows fed diets without MO (3.8 vs. 4.1{\%}). The reduced milk fat concentration in cows fed MO was associated with a higher level of trans-10 18:1, a potent inhibitor of milk fat synthesis. Milk urea nitrogen concentration was increased by MO supplementation, but this effect was not apparent when MO was fed in combination with EO (interaction EO x MO). Results from this study suggest that feeding EO (2 g/d) and MO (350 mg/d) to lactating dairy cows had limited effects on digestion, ruminal fermentation characteristics, milk production, and milk composition.},

abstract = {{\{}D{\}}airy cattle require fibrous feedstuffs in the diet. {\{}H{\}}owever,
defining the fiber requirements requires knowledge of many interacting
components within the diet as well as how the feed is allocated and
processed. {\{}T{\}}o meet the demands of high producing dairy cows for
energy, diets consist of large quantities of concentrates and high
quality forages containing relatively low amounts of fiber. {\{}H{\}}owever,
to maintain normal rumen function and milk fat percentage, a large
portion of the fiber needs to come from forage. {\{}C{\}}urrent {\{}N{\}}ational
{\{}R{\}}esearch {\{}C{\}}ouncil recommendations are a minimum of 25 to 28{\%} dietary
neutral detergent fiber, 75{\%} of which is supplied from forage. {\{}C{\}}hemical
measures of fiber alone are not adequate for ration balancing; fiber
varies in its effectiveness at stimulating chewing. {\{}T{\}}his variation
is greater when feeds contain high amounts of by-products in place
of forages. {\{}T{\}}he effectiveness in stimulation of chewing of fiber
is variable as the particle size and retention times of indigestible
and digestible fiber vary. {\{}C{\}}urrently, little information exists
about the fiber requirements of the cow from immediately postcalving
until peak lactation. {\{}E{\}}arly lactation cows are clearly more limited
by physical fill than are cows in mid and late lactation. {\{}R{\}}ations

abstract = {This study determined the efficacy of the use of 2 commercial inoculants containing Lactobacillus buchneri alone or in combination with homofermentative lactic acid bacteria in improving aerobic stability of corn silage stored in commercial farm silos in northern Italy. In the first survey, samples were collected from 10 farms that did not inoculate their silages and from 10 farms that applied a Pioneer 11A44 inoculant (L. buchneri strain LN4637; Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Des Moines, IA). In the second survey, corn silage samples were collected from 11 farms that did not inoculate their silages and from 11 farms that applied a Pioneer 11CFT inoculant (L. buchneri strain LN40177; Pioneer Hi-Bred International). Inoculants were applied directly through self-propelled forage harvesters, at the recommended rate of 1 g/t of fresh forage, to achieve a final application rate of 1.0 × 10(5) cfu/g of L. buchneri. One corn bunker silo, which had been open for at least 10 d, was examined in detail on each farm. The silages inoculated with L. buchneri had lower concentrations of lactic acid, a lower lactic-to-acetic acid ratio, a lower yeast count, and higher aerobic stability compared with the untreated silages. Unexpectedly, concentrations of acetic acid and 1,2-propanediol, 2 hallmarks of L. buchneri activity, did not differ between treatments and were only numerically higher in the inoculated silages compared with untreated ones, in both surveys. Aerobic stability, on average, was 107 and 121 h in the inoculated silages and 64 and 74 h in the untreated silages, for surveys 1 and 2, respectively, and decreased exponentially as the yeast count in the silage at the time of sampling increased, regardless of treatment. Inoculation with L. buchneri proved to be effective in reducing the yeast count to {\textless}2 log cfu/g of silage in 16 of 21 of the studied farm silages, confirming the ability of this inoculum to enhance the aerobic stability of corn silages in farm bunker silos.},

Research on feeding management in more competitive free-stall settings indicates that frequency of delivery of fresh feed stimulates feed bunk attendance and can affect other aspects of cows' time budgets apart from feeding such as time spent standing vs. lying down. The objective of this study was to examine how the frequency of feed delivery affects the behavior in two farms, one with a conventional and one with automatic milking system (AMS). The feeding frequency was varied from two to three times per day in the conventional dairy farm; one to two times per day in the AMS farm. The experiment was carried out in two different seasons. All behaviours of the cows were monitored in continuous by video recording. As expected, behavioral indices have been significantly affected by environmental conditions both in conventional farm and AMS farm. The variation in the frequency of feed delivery seems to affect the cow behavioural activity only in a limited way and modify only slightly the daily averages of the time spent in different activities mainly increasing the time cows spend standing (+4- 5{\%}).},

abstract = {Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is likely to arise when an easily palatable, high-energy diet meets a ruminal environment not adapted to this type of substrate. Increase of short-chained fatty acids (SCFA) will occur. Eventually, this may result in a transient nadir of ruminal pH below 5.5. Two situations are likely to represent the risk of SARA. First, fresh lactating cows are confronted with a diet considerably differing from that in the dry-period. A diet change carried out too rapidly or without proper transition management will put the animals at risk. Secondly, further in lactation, inaccurate calculation of dry-matter-intake (DMI) leading to wrong roughage/concentrate ratio, an inadequate content of structure within the diet or mistakes in preparing of total mixed rations may produce SARA. The consequences of SARA are diverse and complex. Laminitis is regularly connected to SARA and the negative impact of organic acids on the ruminal wall may lead to parakeratosis enabling translocation of pathogens into the bloodstream provoking inflammation and abscessation throughout the ruminant body. Moreover, milk-fat depression (MFD) can be related to SARA. In order to achieve a proper diagnosis, SARA has to be understood as a herd-management problem. A screening of the herd for SARA by means of a rumenocentesis, performed on a sample-group, preferably 12 individuals, may reveal the presence of SARA. The herd screening should include the risk group suspected, preferably. The prevention of SARA applies to the principles of ruminant feeding. Careful transition management from the dry to the lactation period and control of fibre-content and ration quality should be more yielding than the use of buffers or antibiotic drugs.},

abstract = {Effects of supplemental prilled long-chain fatty acids on lactation performance during heat stress were examined using eight multiparous Holstein cows in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with 15-d periods. Cows were ruminally cannulated and were assigned randomly to one of four treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Factors were 0 or 5{\%} supplemental fat and thermoneutral or heat stress conditions. Cows were housed in environmental chambers with thermoneutral conditions of 20.5 degrees C and 38{\%} relative humidity for 24 h/d or heat stress conditions of 31.8 degrees C and 56{\%} relative humidity for 14 h/d and 25.9 degrees C with 56{\%} relative humidity for 10 h/d. Isonitrogenous diets (17{\%} CP) containing 50{\%} alfalfa silage and 50{\%} concentrate were offered for ad libitum intake. Diets contained 1.64 or 1.83 Mcal NEL/kg DM. No diet by environment interactions were significant. Milk fat percentage (3.46 vs. 3.15{\%}) and 3.5{\%} FCM (31.5 vs. 29.2 kg/d) were higher for cows fed 5 vs. 0{\%} fat. Dry matter intake, milk yield, and milk protein percentage did not differ between diets. Heat stress decreased DMI, milk yield, 3.5{\%} FCM, and milk protein percentage but did not affect milk fat percentage. Results suggest that supplemental fat at 5{\%} of diet DM enhances lactation performance similarly under thermoneutral and heat stress conditions.},

@article{Bertoni2010,
abstract = {Speaking in terms of the general relationship between nutrition and reproduction, many different aspects are more or less involved depending on geographical areas, species, production systems, technological levels etc. There are deficiency conditions: energy, proteins, vitamins and minerals; but also some excesses (namely protein and few minerals) or toxic substances such as micotoxins or plant compounds (i.e. phyto-oestrogens). Their relevance is different in the intensive systems for better feeds and relative easiness to create appropriate diets. Nevertheless, intensification does not reduce the nutritional risks for livestock reproduction for several reasons: namely, a suspected higher susceptibility of high genetic merit cows to the usual stresses. There is also a new risk: metabolic stress (e.g. negative energy balance). The latter is particularly relevant when early lactation and new pregnancy are close (as in dairy cows), however, of great importance are also oxidative stress and disease stress (pro-inflammatory cytokines). In dairy cows, inflammatory phenomena around calving - when an immune response occurs in spite of clinical symptoms are missing - are significantly related to a lower pregnancy rate. A possible explanation can be seen in the pro-inflammatory cytokines, which modify liver synthesis and seem to impair energy balance thereby reducing feed intake and increasing energy expenditure. This suggests that in order to improve fertility not only better feeding mecahnisms, but any husbandry tool that can reduce diseases and health disorders are needed.},

abstract = {Four Holstein cows fitted with ruminal cannulas were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design (28-d periods) with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments to investigate the effects of addition of a specific mixture of essential oil compounds (MEO; 0 vs. 750 mg/d) and silage source [alfalfa silage (AS) vs. corn silage (CS)] on digestion, ruminal fermentation, rumen microbial populations, milk production, and milk composition. Total mixed rations containing either AS or CS as the sole forage source were balanced to be isocaloric and isonitrogenous. In general, no interactions between MEO addition and silage source were observed. Except for ruminal pH and milk lactose content, which were increased by MEO supplementation, no changes attributable to the administration of MEO were observed for feed intake, nutrient digestibility, end-products of ruminal fermentation, microbial counts, and milk performance. Dry matter intake and milk production were not affected by replacing AS with CS in the diet. However, cows fed CS-based diets produced milk with lower fat and higher protein and urea N concentrations than cows fed AS-based diets. Replacing AS with CS increased the concentration of NH(3)-N and reduced the acetate-to-propionate ratio in ruminal fluid. Total viable bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria, and protozoa were not influenced by MEO supplementation, but the total viable bacteria count was higher with CS- than with AS-based diets. The apparent digestibility of crude protein did not differ between the AS and CS treatments, but digestibilities of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber were lower when cows were fed CS-based diets than when they were fed AS-based diets. Duodenal bacterial N flow, estimated using urinary purine derivatives and the amount of N retained, increased in cows fed CS-based diets compared with those fed AS-based diets. Feeding cows AS increased the milk fat contents of cis-9, trans-11 18:2 (conjugated linoleic acid) and 18:3 (n-3 fatty acid) compared with feeding cows CS. Results from this study showed limited effects of MEO supplementation on nutrient utilization, ruminal fermentation, and milk performance when cows were fed diets containing either AS or CS as the sole forage source.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to improve the efficiency of growth and lactation performance of dairy heifers fed for a stair-step growth pattern. Twenty-four young Holstein heifers were randomly assigned to either control or test groups. The test group was fed according to a schedule of 3, 2, 4, 2, 5 and 2 mo in which feed intake was alternately 20{\%} below or 25{\%} above requirements. Heifers that were subjected to the stair-step growth pattern gained more body weight and consumed less dry matter, resulting in improved efficiency of growth compared with that of controls (7.8{\%} vs. 8.3{\%}). First estrus, first conception, gestation period, services per conception, and calving difficulty (dystocia) were not affected by stair-step growth. Concentration of growth hormone in blood serum was elevated during feed restriction for the test heifers; however, during refeeding, growth hormone was decreased compared with that in the blood serum of control heifers. Mammary tissues obtained by biopsy from heifers in middle and late pregnancy were used for chemical composition analysis. Stair-step growth increased DNA, RNA, protein, the ratio of RNA to DNA, and the ratio of protein to DNA. Lipid decreased in the mammary tissue of test heifers in late pregnancy (9.5 mo). Heifers in the test group yielded approximately 9{\%} more milk than did heifers in the control group. These results indicate that compensatory growth can contribute to the improvement of growth efficiency and lactation performance.},

In a 4 x 4 Latin square, four lactating Holstein cows with cannula in the proximal duodenum were infused duodenally with a mixture providing daily 0 (C treatment) or 500 g FA with mainly 16:0 (P treatment), 18:0 (S treatment) or cis-18:1(n-9) (O treatment). Significantly higher arterial concentrations of infused FA in arterial plasma nonesterified FA and triglycerides (NETGFA) were observed with P and O treatments, but the effect of the S treatment was much lower. Arterio-venous differences of NETGFA increased with arterial concentrations. The number of synthesized FA in the mammary gland was not significantly affected by duodenal infusion of FA. Mean chain length was significantly reduced by P and O treatments, suggesting an effect of mammary gland uptake of long-chain FA on the termination process of mammary gland synthesis of FA. Across all treatments, 4:0 mammary gland balance increased linearly (r = 0.67, P = 0.004) with mammary gland FA uptake. Mammary gland desaturation of 18:0 to cis-18:1(n-9) averaged 52{\%} and was not significantly affected by treatments, but was reduced by trans-18:1 mammary gland uptake. Uptake, synthesis and desaturation of FA by the mammary gland of dairy cows are affected by arterial concentrations of 16:0, 18:0 and cis-18:1(n-9).},

abstract = {Wheat straw (Triticum aestivum, cultivar 'Hachimankomugi') was treated with aqueous ammonia (ammonia level: 30 g kg-1 straw) at 25 °C for 36 days and then air dried. Soluble lignins were isolated with 90{\%} aqueous dioxane from ether-extracted residues of the ammonia-treated and untreated wheat straw samples without ultragrinding and their chemical and physical properties were compared. The ammonia-treated wheat straw showed a higher dry matter digestibility (determined by a nylon bag technique) and yielded a larger quantity of dioxane-soluble lignin than the untreated straw. IR spectra indicated the presence of guaiacyl- and syringylpropane units in the two lignins. The two soluble lignins showed similar molecular weight distributions. The lignin preparation from the ammonia-treated straw contained less p-coumaric acid and much more ferulic acid than that from the untreated straw. Most of the p-coumaric acid in both soluble lignins was present in the ester-linked form, whereas ferulic acid was predominantly in the ether-linked form. The lignin from the ammonia-treated straw was much more abundant in ether-linked ferulic acid than that from the untreated straw. The results provided evidence of the solubilization of the ferulic acid ether-rich lignin fraction from wheat straw by ammonia treatment. Mechanisms of the solubilization of wheat straw lignin and improvement of biodegradability of wheat straw by ammonia treatment were discussed in relation to possible ferulic acid cross-linkages in the cell walls. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

{\textless}p{\textgreater}Imprinted genes display differential allelic expression in a manner that depends on the sex of the transmitting parent. The degree of imprinting is often tissue-specific and/or developmental stage-specific, and may be altered in some diseases including cancer. Here we applied Illumina/Solexa sequencing of the transcriptomes of reciprocal F1 mouse neonatal brains and identified 26 genes with parent-of-origin dependent differential allelic expression. Allele-specific Pyrosequencing verified 17 of them, including three novel imprinted genes. The known and novel imprinted genes all are found in proximity to previously reported differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Ten genes known to be imprinted in placenta had sufficient expression levels to attain a read depth that provided statistical power to detect imprinting, and yet all were consistent with non-imprinting in our transcript count data for neonatal brain. Three closely linked and reciprocally imprinted gene pairs were also discovered, and their pattern of expression suggests transcriptional interference. Despite the coverage of more than 5000 genes, this scan only identified three novel imprinted refseq genes in neonatal brain, suggesting that this tissue is nearly exhaustively characterized. This approach has the potential to yield an complete catalog of imprinted genes after application to multiple tissues and developmental stages, shedding light on the mechanism, bioinformatic prediction, and evolution of imprinted genes and diseases associated with genomic imprinting.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

abstract = {The problem of estimating haplotype frequencies from population data has been considered by numerous investigators, resulting in a wide variety of possible algorithmic and statistical solutions. We propose a relatively unique approach that employs an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the most likely haplotype frequencies from a sample of population genotype data. Through an innovative ANN design for mapping genotype patterns to diplotypes, we have produced a prototype that demonstrates the feasibility of this approach, with provisional results that correlate well with estimates produced by the expectation maximization algorithm for haplotype frequency estimation. Given the computational demands of estimating haplotype frequencies for 20 or more single-nucleotide polymorphisms, the ANN approach is promising because its design fits well with parallel computing architectures.},

abstract = {It was hypothesized that buckwheat, especially its flowers, influences foregut fermentation in ruminant animals because it is rich in phenolic compounds. The entire fresh aerial buckwheat herb, or its parts (leaves, stems, flowers and grain), were incubated for 24 h together with pure ryegrass (1:1, dry matter basis) in an in vitro ruminal fermentation system (Hohenheim Gas Test). Additionally ryegrass, supplemented with 0, 0.5, 5, or 50 mg rutin trihydrate/g dry matter, was incubated. Contents of extractable phenols (g/kg dry matter) were the highest in buckwheat flowers (88), followed by leaves (63), and the lowest in ryegrass (8). The levels of production of total gas and volatile fatty acids demonstrated that the nutritional value of buckwheat was slightly lower than that of ryegrass. Compared to ryegrass alone, ruminal transformation of dietary protein-N into ammonia was lower with 50 mg rutin, buckwheat flowers and buckwheat leaves. Thus, these treatments appeared to have partly protected dietary protein from ruminal degradation. Rutin, at the highest level, buckwheat flowers and the total aerial fraction of the buckwheat plant suppressed methane per unit of total gas by {\textgreater}10{\%}, either at elevated (rutin) or reduced total gas volume. This indicates that the ways of the influence on the ruminal fermentation pattern differed between pure rutin and buckwheat. In vivo studies have to confirm these potentially beneficial effects of buckwheat if used as forage for ruminants and clarify the role of further phenolic compounds present in buckwheat.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes three recent studies by the same authors with the objective to study the effect of dietary energy source on the energy balance (EB) and risk for metabolic and reproductive disorders in dairy cows in early lactation. The first study, a literature survey, illustrated that feeding extra glucogenic nutrients relative to lipogenic nutrients, decreased milk fat and seems to decrease plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentration. However studies are scarce and mostly confound the effect of energy source with level of energy intake, compromising eventual effects on EB and fertility. Therefore, in the second study, 16 dairy cows were either fed a glucogenic or a lipogenic diet (isocaloric) and EB was determined in climate-controlled respiration chambers from week 2 until 9 of lactation. Glucogenic diet decreased milk fat yield and milk energy and tended to decrease body fat mobilization compared with lipogenic diet. The objective of the third study was to study the effect of dietary energy source on EB, metabolites and reproduction variables. Dairy cows (n=111) were fed glucogenic, lipogenic or mixed diet from week 3 until week 9 relative to calving. Multiparous cows fed glucogenic diet had lower milk fat yield, higher calculated EB, and lower plasma NEFA, BHBA and liver triacylglyceride concentration and tended to have fewer days to first postpartum ovulation. In conclusion, increasing the glucogenic nutrient availability improved the EB and had potential to reduce the risk for metabolic disorders and to improve reproductive performance in dairy cows.},

abstract = {Besides the widely discussed negative environmental effects of dairy production, such as greenhouse gas emissions, the feeding of large amounts of potentially human-edible feedstuffs to dairy cows is another important sustainability concern. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the effects of a complete substitution of common cereal grains and pulses with a mixture of wheat bran and sugar beet pulp in a high-forage diet on cow performance, production efficiency, feed intake, and ruminating behavior, as well as on net food production potential. Thirteen multiparous and 7 primiparous mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments in a change-over design with 7-wk periods. Cows were fed a high-forage diet (grass silage and hay accounted for 75{\%} of the dry matter intake), supplemented with either a cereal grain-based concentrate mixture (CON), or a mixture of wheat bran and dried sugar beet pulp (WBBP). Human-edible inputs were calculated for 2 different scenarios based on minimum and maximum potential recovery rates of human-edible energy and protein from the respective feedstuffs. Dietary starch and neutral detergent fiber contents were 3.0 and 44.1{\%} for WBBP, compared with 10.8 and 38.2{\%} in CON, respectively. Dietary treatment did not affect milk production, milk composition, feed intake, or total chewing activity. However, chewing index expressed in minutes per kilogram of neutral detergent fiber ingested was 12{\%} lower in WBBP compared with CON. In comparison to CON, the human-edible feed conversion efficiencies for energy and protein, defined as human-edible output per human-edible input, were 6.8 and 5.3 times higher, respectively, in WBBP under the maximum scenario. For the maximum scenario, the daily net food production (human-edible output minus human-edible input) increased from 5.4 MJ and 250 g of crude protein per cow in CON to 61.5 MJ and 630 g of crude protein in the WBBP diet. In conclusion, our data suggest that in forage-based dairy production systems, wheat bran and sugar beet pulp could replace common cereal grains in mid-lactation dairy cows without impairing performance, while strongly increasing human-edible feed conversion efficiency and net food production index.},

abstract = {Three experiments were conducted to test the effectiveness of different footbath solutions and regimens in the treatment of digital dermatitis (DD) in dairy cows. During the study, groups of cows walked through allocated footbath solutions after milking on 4 consecutive occasions. All cows were scored weekly for DD lesion stage on the hind feet during milking. A "transition grade" was assigned on the basis of whether the DD lesions improved (1) or deteriorated or did not improve (0) from week to week. This grade per cow was averaged for all cows in the group. In experiment 1, 118 cows were allocated to 1 of 3 footbath treatments for 5 wk: (1) 5{\%} CuSO(4) each week, (2) 2{\%} ClO(-) each week, or (3) no footbath (control). The mean transition grade, and proportion of cows without DD lesions at the end of the trial were significantly higher for treatment 1 above (0.36, 0.13, and 0.11, respectively; standard error of the difference, SED = 0.057). In experiment 2, 117 cows were allocated to 1 of 4 footbath treatment regimens for 8 wk: (1) 5{\%} CuSO(4) each week, (2) 2{\%} CuSO(4) each week, (3) 5{\%} CuSO(4) each fortnight, or (4) 2{\%} CuSO(4) each fortnight. For welfare reasons, cows allocated to the weekly and fortnightly footbath regimens had an average prevalence of {\textgreater}60{\%} and ≤25{\%} active DD at the start of the trial, respectively. Significantly more cows had no DD lesions (0.53 vs. 0.36, respectively; SED = 0.049), and the mean transition grade of DD lesions was higher in the 5{\%} compared with the 2{\%} weekly CuSO(4) treatment (0.52 vs. 0.38, respectively; SED = 0.066). Similarly, significantly more cows had no DD lesions in the 5{\%} compared with the 2{\%} fortnightly CuSO(4) treatments (0.64 vs. 0.47, respectively; SED = 0.049). In experiment 3, 95 cows were allocated to 1 of 3 footbath treatments: (1) each week alternating 5{\%} CuSO(4) with 10{\%} salt water, (2) each week alternating 5{\%} CuSO(4) with water, or (3) 5{\%} CuSO(4) each fortnight (control). After 10 wk, more cows had no DD in the salt water treatment than in the control treatment (0.35 vs. 0.26, respectively; SED = 0.038), but levels of active lesions were higher for this treatment than in the other 2 treatments (0.17, 0.00, and 0.13, respectively; SED = 0.029). Treatment did not affect mean transition grade of DD lesions. In conclusion, CuSO(4) was the only footbath solution that was consistently effective for treatment of DD. In cases when DD prevalence was high, a footbath each week using 5{\%} CuSO(4) was the most effective treatment.},

abstract = {In this study, we tested the effects of the inclusion in silages of bioactive legumes containing condensed tannins (CT) or polyphenol oxidase (PPO), ensiled alone or in mixture with one grass species, on in vitro rumen fermentations. Six mini-silos were prepared in triplicate as follows: pure sainfoin (SF), pure red clover (RC), pure timothy (T, control without bioactive compounds); binary mixtures T-SF and T-RC (in g/kg on a DM basis, 500:500); ternary mixture T-SF-RC (in g/kg on a DM basis, 500:250:250). Samples from each mini-silo were incubated under anaerobic conditions in culture bottles containing buffered rumen fluid from sheep. Rumen fermentation parameters, namely DM disappearance, volatile fatty acids (VFA), ammonia (NH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}), gas production and methane (CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) were determined. The presence of RC in mixtures with T or T-SF results in fermentation similar to pure T and a positive associative effect between T and RC on total VFA production was observed (P=0.029). The NH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}: total N ratio was similar among the treatments, but lower values for NH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}: insoluble N ratio in silages containing SF or RC (P{\textless}0.05, except for T-SF) indicates that the bioactive compounds can limit silage protein degradation in the rumen. The CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} production per g of DM only tended to differ among treatments (P=0.096), being slightly lower for pure SF than for pure T and RC, probably due to differences in the fermentation pathways towards less acetate and butyrate productions. Overall, the benefits of including RC in forage mixtures previously observed on silage quality are also present on ruminal digestion efficiency.},

Despite considerable efforts, there has been only limited success in identifying the polymorphisms that cause variation in these traits. Nevertheless, selection based on estimated breeding values (BVs), calculated from data on phenotypic performance and pedigree has been very successful. Genomic tools, such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips, have led to a new method of selection called 'genomic selection' in which dense SNP genotypes covering the genome are used to predict the BV. In this review we consider the statistical methodology for estimating BVs from SNP data, factors affecting the accuracy, the long-term response to genomic selection and the design of breeding programmes including the management of inbreeding.},

Cows in their second lactation or greater (n=927) from 2 large dairies in Wisconsin were enrolled during the summer of 2010. Both herds were fed supplemental anions during the prefresh period and less than 1{\%} of fresh cows were treated for clinical milk fever. Cows were scored before calving for lameness and body condition, and then randomly assigned to either a control group or an oral Ca bolus-supplemented group. Control cows received no oral Ca boluses around calving. Cows in the oral Ca bolus group received 2 oral Ca boluses (Bovikalc, Boehringer Ingelheim, St. Joseph, MO), one bolus 0 to 2h after calving and the second 8 to 35 h after calving. The oral Ca bolus administration schedule allowed fresh cows to be restrained in headlocks only once daily. Whole-blood samples were collected immediately before the second oral Ca bolus was given and were analyzed for ionized Ca (Ca(2+)) concentration. Early-lactation health events were recorded and summed for each cow. Only 6 cases (0.6{\%} of calvings) of clinical milk fever occurred during the trial, and only 14{\%} of cows tested were hypocalcemic (Ca(2+) less than 1.0 mmol/L) at 8 to 35 h after calving. Mean Ca(2+) concentrations were not different between the control and oral Ca bolus-supplemented groups. Blood samples from the cows given oral Ca boluses were collected an average of 20.6 h after administration of the first bolus. Subpopulations of cows with significant responses to oral Ca bolus supplementation were identified based on significant interactions between oral Ca bolus supplementation and covariates in mixed multiple regression models. Lame cows supplemented with oral Ca boluses averaged 0.34 fewer health events in the first 30 d in milk compared with lame cows that were not supplemented with oral Ca boluses. Cows with a higher previous lactation mature-equivalent milk production (greater than 105{\%} of herd rank) and supplemented with oral Ca boluses produced 2.9 kg more milk at their first test after calving compared with cows with higher previous lactation milk yields that were not supplemented. Results of this study indicate that lame cows and higher producing cows responded favorably to supplementation with oral Ca boluses. Supplementing targeted subpopulations of cows with oral Ca boluses was beneficial even for dairies with a very low incidence of hypocalcemia.},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to develop and test a system for automatic washing of the hooves of dairy cows and to evaluate the effect of frequent automatic washing on the prevalence of digital dermatitis (DD). An automatic hoof washer was developed in an experimental dairy herd and tested in 6 commercial dairy herds in 2 experiments (1 and 2). In the experimental herd, automatic hoof washing resulted in cleaner hooves. In experiments 1 and 2, cows were washed after each milking on the left side only, leaving the right side unwashed as a within-cow control. In experiment 1, hooves were washed with a water and 0.4{\%} soap solution. In experiment 2, hooves were washed with water only. In each experiment, DD was scored in a hoof-trimming chute approximately 60 d after the start of hoof washing. Data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model. The outcome was the DD status of each leg (DD positive or DD negative). Herd and cow within herd were included as random effects, and treatment (washing or control) was included as a fixed effect. The statistical analyses showed that the odds ratio of having DD was 1.48 in the control leg compared with the washed leg in experiment 1. In experiment 2, the odds ratio of having DD was 1.27 in the control leg compared with the washed leg. We concluded that automatic washing of hooves with water and soap can help decrease the prevalence of DD in commercial dairy herds.},

Hansen Animal Health and Nutrition, Milwaukee, WI). Treated forage was ensiled in quadruplicate in mini silos at a density of 172 kg of DM/m(3) for 3 and 120 d. After 3 d of ensiling, the pH of all silages was below 4 but ethanol concentrations were least in BEN silage (2.03 vs. 3.24{\%} DM) and lactic acid was greatest in SAV silage (2.97 vs. 2.51{\%} DM). Among 120-d silages, additives did not affect DM recovery (mean=89.8{\%} ± 2.27) or in vitro DM digestibility (mean=71.5{\%} ± 0.63). The SAV silage had greater ammonia-N (0.85 g/kg of DM) and butyric acid (0.22 vs. 0.0{\%} DM) than other treatments. In contrast, BEN and Silo-King silages had the least ammonia-N concentration and had no butyric acid. The BEN and A. pasteurianus silages had the lowest pH (3.69) and BEN silage had the least ethanol (1.04{\%} DM) and ammonia nitrogen (0.64 g/kg DM) concentrations, suggesting that fermentation was more extensive and protein degradation was less in BEN silages. The BUC and BIO silages had greater acetic acid concentrations than control silages (3.19 and 3.19 vs. 2.78{\%} DM), but yeast counts did not differ. Aerobic stability was increased by 64{\%} by BUC (44.30 h) and by 35{\%} by BEN (36.49 h), but other silages had similar values (27.0±1.13 h).},

abstract = {Neonatal calf diarrhoea can have important economic consequences. Scour vaccines are available against some of the most frequent pathogens responsible for this disease: Bovine Rotavirus (BoRV), Bovine Coronavirus (BoCV) and E. coli K99. In this multi-centre, randomised, blinded study, adult cows vaccinated with a trivalent vaccine marketed for years (Rotavec™ Corona, MSD Animal Health - RC) prior to last parturition were revaccinated 12–15 months later, prior to the upcoming parturition, with either a single injection of a recently marketed vaccine (Bovigen™ Scour, Virbac - BS), or RC. The aim of this trial was to verify whether BS is not inferior to RC for the stimulation of the immune response and the passive transfer to calves in these conditions. A total of 136 multiparous dairy cows, from 5 different herds and located in 3 countries (France, UK and Germany) were enrolled in the study. Sixty-five cows were vaccinated with BS and 71 with RC. Antibody levels, measured by competitive ELISA and represented as percentage of inhibition (PI), were assessed in the cow's serum (on the day of vaccination: D0 and on days 21, 42 and at calving), in the colostrum and in the serum of calves in the first week of life. Differences in means of PI between groups and the 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) were calculated. The non-inferiority threshold was set at −10{\%}. The relationships between antibody levels in the colostrum and the vaccination-calving interval (VCI) or the inter-booster vaccination interval (IBVI) were also analysed. All the lower margins of the 95{\%} CI of the difference in means of PI, in all samples and for the 3 pathogens assessed, were above −10{\%}. This result shows that BS is not inferior to RC for the stimulation of the immune response against BoRV, BoCV and E. coli K99 and the passive transfer of immunity to calves when this vaccine is administered to their dams previously vaccinated with RC. Furthermore, no correlation was found between PI values in the colostrum and the VCI or IBVI. The ratio of animals with a PI ≥ 95{\%} in the colostrum, among cows with similar intervals, was not significantly different between groups, for all antigens tested. Therefore, this study shows that a single injection of the heterologous vaccine BS can be used as a booster in cattle previously vaccinated with RC.},

abstract = {Milk urea nitrogen (MUN) is correlated with N balance, N intake, and dietary N content, and thus is a good indicator of proper feeding management with respect to protein. It is commonly used to monitor feeding programs to achieve environmental goals; however, genetic diversity also exists among cows. It was hypothesized that phenotypic diversity among cows could bias feed management decisions when monitoring tools do not consider genetic diversity associated with MUN. The objective of the work was to evaluate the effect of cow and herd variation on MUN. Data from 2 previously published research trials and a field trial were subjected to multivariate regression analyses using a mixed model. Analyses of the research trial data showed that MUN concentrations could be predicted equally well from diet composition, milk yield, and milk components regardless of whether dry matter intake was included in the regression model. This indicated that cow and herd variation could be accurately estimated from field trial data when feed intake was not known. Milk urea N was correlated with dietary protein and neutral detergent fiber content, milk yield, milk protein content, and days in milk for both data sets. Cow was a highly significant determinant of MUN regardless of the data set used, and herd trended to significance for the field trial data. When all other variables were held constant, a percentage unit change in dietary protein concentration resulted in a 1.1mg/dL change in MUN. Least squares means estimates of MUN concentrations across herds ranged from a low of 13.6mg/dL to a high of 17.3mg/dL. If the observed MUN for the high herd were caused solely by high crude protein feeding, then the herd would have to reduce dietary protein to a concentration of 12.8{\%} of dry matter to achieve a MUN concentration of 12mg/dL, likely resulting in lost milk production. If the observed phenotypic variation is due to genetic differences among cows, genetic choices could result in herds that exceed target values for MUN when adhering to best management practices, which is consistent with the trend for differences in MUN among herds.},

abstract = {The experimental knowledge on efficacy, possible modes of action and aspects of application of Chinese herbs as feed additives for animal production are reviewed in this article. Chinese herbs commonly contain protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, and mineral which are necessary nutrients to the growth of animal. Polysaccharide, organic acid, alkaloids, and essential oils involved in Chinese herbs can improve the immune function of livestock. Currently, numerous studies have demonstrated anti-oxidative and anti-microbial efficacy and the assumption that Chinese herbs may improve the flavor of meat, which has been confirmed by some observations, but the mode of this action is still unclear. Moreover, several observations support the hypothesis that herbal feed additives may favorably affect gut functions (e.g., enzyme activity, microbial eubiosis) in vitro. Such effects may explain a considerable number of practical studies with livestock reporting improved production performance after providing herbal feed additives. In summary, available evidence indicates that herbal feed additives may have the potential to add to the set of non-antibiotic growth promoters for use in livestock, such as organic acids and probiotics. However, a systematic approach toward the efficacy, mode of action and safety of herbal compounds used as feed additives for animal production seems to be required in the future. {\textcopyright} 2011 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.},

abstract = {Faithful reconstruction of haplotypes from diploid
marker data (phasing) is important for many kinds of
genetic analyses, including mapping of trait loci,
prediction of genomic breeding values, and
identification of signatures of selection. In human
genetics, phasing most often exploits population
information (linkage disequilibrium), while in
animal genetics the primary source of information is
familial (Mendelian segregation and linkage). We
herein develop and evaluate a method that
simultaneously exploits both sources of
information. It builds on hidden Markov models that
were initially developed to exploit population
information only. We demonstrate that the approach
improves the accuracy of allele phasing as well as
imputation of missing genotypes. Reconstructed
haplotypes are assigned to hidden states that are
shown to correspond to clusters of genealogically
related chromosomes. We show that these cluster
states can directly be used to fine map QTL. The
method is computationally effective at handling
large data sets based on high-density SNP panels. },

abstract = {The results of adding Lactobacillus buchneri to silages from 43 experiments in 23 sources reporting standard errors were summarized using meta-analysis. The effects of inoculation were summarized by type of crop (corn or grass and small grains) and the treatments were classified into the following categories: 1) untreated silage with nothing applied (LB0), 2) silage treated with L. buchneri at {\textless} or = 100,000 cfu/g of fresh forage (LB1), and 3) silage treated with L. buchneri at {\textgreater} 100,000 cfu/g (LB2). In both types of crops, inoculation with L. buchneri decreased concentrations of lactic acid, and this response was dose-dependent in corn but not in grass and small-grain silages. Treatment with L. buchneri markedly increased the concentrations of acetic acid in both crops in a dose-dependent manner. The numbers of yeasts were lower in silages treated with LB1 and further decreased in silages treated with LB2 compared with untreated silages. Untreated corn silage spoiled after 25 h of exposure to air but corn silage treated with LB1 did not spoil until 35 h, and this stability was further enhanced to 503 h with LB2. In grass and small-grain silages, yeasts were nearly undetectable; however, inoculation improved aerobic stability in a dose-dependent manner (206, 226, and 245 h for LB0, LB1, and LB2, respectively). The recovery of DM after ensiling was lower for LB2 (94.5{\%}) when compared with LB0 (95.5{\%}) in corn silage and was lower for both LB1 (94.8{\%}) and LB2 (95.3{\%}) when compared with LB0 (96.6{\%}) in grass and small-grain silages.},

abstract = {Background: Escherichia coli O157:H7 is the most common serovar of enterohemorrhagic E. coli associated with serious human disease outbreaks. Cattle are the main reservoir with E. coli O157:H7 inducing hemorrhagic enteritis in persistent shedding beef cattle, however little is known about how this pathogen affects cattle health. Jejunal Hemorrhage Syndrome (JHS) has unclear etiology but the pathology is similar to that described for E. coli O157:H7 challenged beef cattle suggestive that E. coli O157:H7 could be involved. There are no effective treatments for JHS however new approaches to managing pathogen issues in livestock using prebiotics and probiotics are gaining support. The first objective of the current study was to characterize pathogen colonization in hemorrhaged jejunum of dairy cattle during natural JHS outbreaks. The second objective was to confirm the association of mycotoxigenic fungi in feeds with the development of JHS and also to identify the presence of potential mycotoxins. The third objective was to determine the impact of a prebiotic, Celmanax™, or probiotic, Dairyman's Choice™ paste, on the cytotoxicity associated with feed extracts in vitro. The fourth objective was to determine the impact of a prebiotic or a probiotic on E. coli O157:H7 colonization of mucosal explants and a bovine colonic cell line in vitro. The final objective was to determine if prebiotic and probiotic feed additives could modify the symptoms that preceded JHS losses and the development of new JHS cases. Findings: Dairy cattle developed JHS after consuming feed containing several types of mycotoxigenic fungi including Fusarium culmorum, F. poae, F. verticillioides, F. sporotrichioides, Aspergillusflavus, Penicillium roqueforti, P. crustosum, P. paneum and P. citrinum. Mixtures of Shiga toxin -producing Escherichia coli (STEC) colonized the mucosa in the hemorrhaged tissues of the cattle and no other pathogen was identified. The STECs expressed Stx1 and Stx2, but more significantly, Stxs were also present in the blood clot blocking the jejunum. Mycotoxin analysis of the corn crop confirmed the presence of fumonisin, NIV, ZEAR, DON, 15-ADON, 3-ADON, NEO, DAS, HT-2 and T-2. Feed extracts were toxic to enterocytes and 0.1{\%} Celmanax™ removed the cytotoxicity in vitro. There was no effect of Dairyman's Choice™ paste on feed-extract activity in vitro. Fumonisin, T-2, ZEAR and DON were toxic to bovine cells and 0.1{\%} Celmanax™ removed the cytotoxicity in vitro. Celmanax™ also directly decreased E. coli O157:H7 colonization of mucosal explants and a colonic cell line in a dose-dependent manner. There was no effect of Dairyman's Choice™ paste on E. coli O157:H7 colonization in vitro. The inclusion of the prebiotic and probiotic in the feed was associated with a decline in disease. Conclusion: The current study confirmed an association between mycotoxigenic fungi in the feed and the development of JHS in cattle. This association was further expanded to include mycotoxins in the feed and},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare effects of inorganic sulfate versus chelated forms of supplemental Cu, Mn, and Zn on milk production, plasma and milk mineral concentrations, neutrophil activity, and antibody titer response to a model vaccination. Holstein cows (n=25) were assigned in 2 cohorts based on calving date to a 12-wk randomized complete block design study. The first cohort consisted of 17 cows that had greater days in milk (DIM; mean of 77 DIM at the start of the trial) than the second cohort of 8 cows (32 DIM at the start of the trial). Diets were formulated to supplement 100{\%} of National Research Council requirements of Cu, Mn, and Zn by either inorganic trace minerals (ITM) in sulfate forms or chelated trace minerals (CTM) supplied as metal methionine hydroxy analog chelates, without accounting for trace mineral contribution from other dietary ingredients. Intake and milk production were recorded daily. Milk composition was measured weekly, and milk Cu, Mn, and Zn were determined at wk 0 and 8. Plasma Cu and Zn concentrations and neutrophil activity were measured at wk 0, 4, 8, and 12. Neutrophil activity was measured by in vitro assays of chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and reactive oxygen species production. A rabies vaccination was administered at wk 8, and vaccine titer response at wk 12 was measured by both rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test and ELISA. Analyzed dietary Cu was 21 and 23mg/kg, Mn was 42 and 46mg/kg, and Zn was 73 and 94mg/kg for the ITM and CTM diets, respectively. No effect of treatment was observed on milk production, milk composition, or plasma minerals. Dry matter intake was reduced for CTM compared with ITM cows, but this was largely explained by differences in body weight between treatments. Milk Cu concentration was greater for CTM than ITM cows, but this effect was limited to the earlier DIM cohort of cows and was most pronounced for multiparous compared with primiparous cows. Measures of neutrophil function were unaffected by treatment except for an enhancement in neutrophil phagocytosis with the CTM treatment found for the later DIM cohort of cows only. Rabies antibody titer in CTM cows was 2.8 fold that of ITM cows as measured by ELISA, with a trend for the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test. Supplementation of Cu, Mn, and Zn as chelated sources may enhance immune response of early lactation dairy cows compared with cows supplemented with inorganic sources.},

abstract = {The control of foetal growth is poorly understood and yet it is critically important that at birth the body has attained appropriate size and proportions. Growth and survival of the mammalian foetus is dependent upon a functional placenta throughout most of gestation. A few genes are known that influence both foetal and placental growth and might therefore coordinate growth of the conceptus, including the imprinted Igf2 and Grb10 genes. Grb10 encodes a signalling adapter protein, is expressed predominantly from the maternally-inherited allele and acts to restrict foetal and placental growth. Here, we show that following disruption of the maternal allele in mice, the labyrinthine volume was increased in a manner consistent with a cell-autonomous function of Grb10 and the enlarged placenta was more efficient in supporting foetal growth. Thus, Grb10 is the first example of a gene that acts to limit placental size and efficiency. In addition, we found that females inheriting a mutant Grb10 allele from their mother had larger litters and smaller offspring than those inheriting a mutant allele from their father. This grandparental effect suggests Grb10 can influence reproductive strategy through the allocation of maternal resources such that offspring number is offset against size.},

abstract = {Effects of corn silage crop processing and chop length on intake, digestion, and milk production were evaluated. Corn silage treatments were harvested at one-half milkline stage of maturity (65{\%} whole-plant moisture content) and at 0.95-cm theoretical length of cut without processing (control) or 0.95-, 1.45-, or 1.90-cm theoretical length of cut with processing at a 1-mm roll clearance. Twenty-four multiparous Holstein cows averaging 71 d in milk at trial initiation were in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with 28-d periods; one square was comprised of ruminally cannulated cows for rumen measurements. Corn silage treatments were fed in total mixed rations containing 50{\%} forage (67{\%} corn silage and 33{\%} alfalfa silage) and 50{\%} corn and soybean meal based concentrate (dry matter basis). Dry matter intake (25.9 vs. 25.3 kg/d) and milk (46.0 vs. 44.8 kg/ d) and fat (1.42 vs. 1.35 kg/d) yields were higher for the processed corn silage treatments compared with the control corn silage. Within the processed corn silage treatments, there were no chop length effects on intake, milk production, or milk composition. Chewing activity was not different among the four corn silage treatments averaging 12 h/d. Total tract digestion of dietary starch was lower for control corn silage (95.1{\%}) compared with fine, medium, and coarse processed corn silage treatments, which averaged 99.3{\%}. Total tract digestion of dietary NDF was reduced for fine-processed corn silage compared with control corn silage and coarse-processed corn silage (28.4{\%} vs. 33.9 and 33.7{\%}, respectively). Processing corn silage improved dry matter intake, starch digestion, and lactation performance. Under the conditions of this study and with theoretical lengths of cut ranging from 0.95 to 1.90 cm, length of chop effects were minimal in processed corn silage.},

abstract = {Acute acidosis was induced in sheep, and gastrointestinal permeability was assessed by using lactulose as a permeability marker. Metabolism was evaluated by monitoring blood metabolites. Four rams (72.5 ± 4.6 kg BW) were used in a 2 × 2 changeover design experiment. The experimental period lasted 96 h from -24 to 72 h. After 24 h of fasting (from -24 to 0 h) for both controls and acidosis-induced rams (ACID), 0.5 kg of wheat flour was orally dosed at 0 and 12 h of the experimental period to ACID, while the basal diet (grass hay, ad libitum) was restored to control. At 24 h, a lactulose solution (30 g of lactulose in 200 mL of water) was orally administered. Blood samples were collected at -24, 0, 24, 48, and 72 h of the experimental periods for the analysis of metabolic profiles and during the 10 h after lactulose dosage to monitor lactulose changes in blood. In addition, rumen and fecal samples were collected at 24 h of the experimental period. The acidotic challenge markedly reduced (P {\textless} 0.01) rumen pH and VFA but increased rumen d- and l-lactic acid (P {\textless} 0.01). Concurrently, a decrease of fecal pH and VFA occurred in ACID (P {\textless} 0.01), together with an abrupt increase (P {\textless} 0.01) of lactate and fecal alkaline phosphatase. Blood lactulose was significantly increased in ACID peaking 2 h after lactulose dosage. Blood glucose, $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, Ca, K, Mg, and alkaline phosphatase showed a significant reduction (P {\textless} 0.05) at 24 h, whereas urea and NEFA declined (P {\textless} 0.05) from 48 to 72 h. A strong inflammatory acute phase response with oxidative stress in ACID group was observed from 24 to 72 h; higher values of haptoglobin (P {\textless} 0.01) were measured from 24 to 72 h and of ceruloplasmin from 48 (P {\textless} 0.05) to 72 h (P {\textless} 0.01). Among the negative acute phase reactants, plasma albumin, cholesterol, paraoxonase, and Zn concentration also decreased (P {\textless} 0.05) in ACID at different time points between 24 and 72 h after acidotic challenge start. A rise (P {\textless} 0.05) of reactive oxygen metabolites and a drop of vitamin E (P {\textless} 0.01) between 24 and 72 h were indicative of oxidative stress in ACID. The perturbation of these blood metabolites suggests that acute acidosis was effectively induced by our model. The increase of lactulose in blood in ACID indicates that gastrointestinal permeability for the marker increased and the large increment after 2 h from dosage suggests that most of the passage occurred through the rumen or abomasal walls.},

abstract = {Two experiments evaluated milk production, serum progesterone and insulin, and reproductive performance of lactating Holstein cows receiving or not receiving Ca salts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), or receiving Ca salts of PUFA at different daily frequencies. In experiment 1, 1,125 cows randomly distributed in 10 freestall barns were enrolled. Barns were assigned randomly to receive a high-concentrate diet containing (PF) or not containing (control, CON) 1.1{\%} (dry matter basis) Ca salts of PUFA. Diets were offered 6 times daily, whereas the Ca salts of PUFA were included in the PF treatment in the first feeding of the day. In experiment 2, 1,572 cows were randomly distributed in 10 freestall barns, which were assigned randomly to receive a diet similar to PF, but with Ca salts of PUFA included only in the first feeding of the day (PF1X), or equally distributed across all 6 feedings (PF6X). During both experiments, cows were artificially inseminated 12h after the onset of estrus. Once per month, cows that did not conceive to artificial insemination were assigned to a fixed-time embryo transfer protocol. Pregnancy was determined via transrectal ultrasonography 28 and 60d after expected ovulation. Pregnancy loss was considered in cows that were pregnant on d 28 but nonpregnant on d 60. During both experiments, feed intake, milk yield, and milk protein and fat content were recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected concurrently with embryo transfer. During experiment 1, feed intake was similar between treatments. Compared with CON, PF cows had greater milk yield (37.8 vs. 35.3kg/d), and reduced milk fat content (3.41 vs. 3.55{\%}). However, PF cows had reduced pregnancy losses per service compared with CON (12.6 vs. 18.3{\%}). Serum progesterone was greater and serum insulin tended to be greater in primiparous cows receiving PF compared with CON cohorts (4.50 vs. 3.67ng of progesterone/mL, and 10.4 vs. 7.5µUI of insulin/mL). During experiment 2, no treatment effects were detected for feed intake, milk yield, or milk fat, whereas PF1X cows tended to have reduced pregnancy losses per service compared with PF6X (14.4 vs. 18.4{\%}). In summary, feeding Ca salts of PUFA to dairy cows increased milk production, did not alter feed intake, and reduced pregnancy losses per service. Further, the total daily amount of Ca salts of PUFA should be fed during the first feeding of the day to optimize its benefits on pregnancy maintenance of dairy cows.},

@article{Colman2013a,
abstract = {Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is one of the most important metabolic disorders, traditionally characterized by low rumen pH, which might be induced by an increase in the dietary proportion of grains as well as by a reduction of structural fiber. Both approaches were used in earlier published experiments in which SARA was induced by replacing part of the ration by a grain mixture or alfalfa hay by alfalfa pellets. The main differences between both experiments were the presence of blood lipopolysaccharide and Escherichia coli and associated effects on the rumen microbial population in the rumen of grain-based induced SARA animals as well as a great amount of quickly fermentable carbohydrates in the grain-based SARA induction experiment. Both induction approaches changed rumen pH although the pH decrease was more substantial in the alfalfa-based SARA induction protocol. The goal of the current analysis was to assess whether both acidosis induction approaches provoked similar shifts in the milk fatty acid (FA) profile. Similar changes of the odd- and branched-chain FA and the C18 biohydrogenation intermediates were observed in the alfalfa-based SARA induction experiment and the grain-based SARA induction experiment, although they were more pronounced in the former. The proportion of trans-10 C18:1 in the last week of the alfalfa-based induction experiment was 6 times higher than the proportion measured during the control week. The main difference between both induction experiments under similar rumen pH changes was the decreasing sum of iso FA during the grain-based SARA induction experiment whereas the sum of iso FA remained stable during the alfalfa-based SARA induction experiment. The cellulolytic bacterial community seemed to be negatively affected by either the presence of E. coli and the associated lipopolysaccharide accumulation in the rumen or by the amount of starch and quickly fermentable carbohydrates in the diet. In general, changes in the milk FA profile were related to changes in rumen pH. Nevertheless, feed characteristics (low in structural fiber vs. high in starch) also affected the milk FA profile and, as such, both effects should be taken into account when subacute acidosis occurs.},

abstract = {To determine the optimum feeding level of fatty acids of palm oil (PALM; Energizer RP10; 86.6{\%} palmitic acid) on milk production, lactating cows (n = 18) were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence in replicated 4 x 4 Latin squares. Animals were assigned to squares by parity (3 multiparous and 1 primiparous squares with primiparous in the incomplete square). The 4 diets were designed to provide 0, 500, 1,000, and 1,500 g of PALM per day. Cows were fed individually with feed intake measured daily. Each period lasted 16 d with milk production and composition determined the final 2 d. Milk production, milk composition and feed intake data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Milk yields were 30.9, 34.0, 34.2, and 34.2 kg/ d (SEM = 1.9) for the 0, 500, 1,000, and 1,500 g levels, respectively. Milk yield was increased by the addition of PALM; however, there were no differences among the levels of PALM. Milk fat percentage was also increased from 3.44{\%} for 0 g to 3.95{\%} (SEM = 0.17) across all levels of PALM but there were no differences among the PALM treatments. Dry matter intakes were 23.3, 26.4, 24.7, and 23.8 kg/d (SEM = 1.4) for the 0, 500, 1,000 and 1,500 g levels, respectively. The addition of PALM increased milk yield and milk fat percentage, and no adverse effects on dry matter intake were observed.},

abstract = {An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of plane of energy intake prepartum on postpartum performance. Primiparous (n=24) and multiparous (n=23) Holsteins were randomly assigned by expected date of parturition to 1 of 3 prepartum energy intakes. A moderate energy diet [1.63 Mcal of net energy for lactation (NE(L))/kg; 15{\%} crude protein (CP)] was fed for either ad libitum intake (OVR) or restricted intake (RES) to supply 150 or 80{\%} of National Research Council (2001) energy requirement, respectively, for dry cows in late gestation. To limit energy intake to 100{\%} of NRC requirement at ad libitum dry matter intake (DMI), chopped wheat straw was included as 31.8{\%} of dry matter (DM) in a control diet (CON; 1.21 Mcal of NE(L)/kg of DM; 14{\%} CP). Multiparous and primiparous cows assigned to OVR gained body condition during the dry period [initial body condition score (BCS)=3.3], but were not overconditioned by parturition (BCS=3.5). Multiparous cows in the OVR group lost more BCS postpartum than multiparous RES or CON cows. Primiparous cows lost similar amounts of BCS among dietary treatment groups postpartum. Addition of chopped wheat straw to CON diets prevented a large decrease in DMI prepartum in both primiparous and multiparous cows. During the first 3 wk postpartum, DMI as a percentage of BW was lower for multiparous OVR cows than for multiparous RES cows. Prepartum diet effects did not carry over through the entire 8-wk lactation period. Because of greater mobilization of body stores, OVR cows had greater milk fat percentage and greater 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk yield during the first 3 wk postpartum. Multiparous cows assigned to OVR experienced a 55{\%} decrease in energy balance and primiparous cows a 40{\%} decrease in energy balance during the last 3 wk before parturition, compared with CON or RES cows that had little change. Multiparous cows fed OVR had a greater contribution of energy from body energy reserves to milk energy output than either CON or RES cows. Overfeeding energy prepartum resulted in large changes in periparturient energy balance. Even in the absence of overconditioning, a large change in DMI and energy balance prepartum influenced postpartum DMI and BCS loss, especially for multiparous cows. Chopped wheat straw was effective at controlling energy intake prepartum, although primiparous cows did not achieve predicted DMI. Even so, controlling or restricting energy intake in primiparous cows was not detrimental to lactational performance over the first 8 wk of lactation.},

abstract = {One primiparous and 3 multiparous lactating Holstein cows fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannulas were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design to determine the efficacy of adding urea to a corn silage-based diet on ruminal fermentation and microbial protein synthesis. Dietary treatments were 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9{\%} urea in diet dry matter (DM); urea was manually top dressed and incorporated into the ration. The basal diet contained (DM basis) 52{\%} forage (with 61{\%} of forage provided as corn silage) and 48{\%} concentrate ingredients. The basal diet was formulated to meet National Research Council (NRC, 2001) requirements for energy and all nutrients except rumen-degradable protein (RDP) and metabolizable protein. Experimental periods lasted 14 d with the first 9 d for adaptation. The basal diet, without urea addition, contained 9.2{\%} RDP in DM and had a predicted RDP balance of -167 g/d (NRC, 2001). There were no effects of dietary treatment on ruminal true digestibility of organic matter or ruminal apparent digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber. Total ruminal volatile fatty acid concentrations increased linearly with increasing urea level. Feeding increasing amounts of urea quadratically increased rumen ammonia N concentrations (9.0, 11.9, 12.8, and 17.4 mg/dL at 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9{\%} urea supplementation, respectively), passage of microbial N, and microbial N in duodenal digesta as a percentage of nonammonia N. The results of this study indicate that there were some positive effects of adding urea to the described lactating dairy cow diet, and that microbial protein synthesis was maximized at an average ruminal ammonia N concentration of 12.8 mg/dL when urea was added at 0.6{\%} in diet DM.},

abstract = {The first national single-step, full-information (phenotype, pedigree, and marker genotype) genetic evaluation was developed for final score of US Holsteins. Data included final scores recorded from 1955 to 2009 for 6,232,548 Holsteins cows. BovineSNP50 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) genotypes from the Cooperative Dairy DNA Repository (Beltsville, MD) were available for 6,508 bulls. Three analyses used a repeatability animal model as currently used for the national US evaluation. The first 2 analyses used final scores recorded up to 2004. The first analysis used only a pedigree-based relationship matrix. The second analysis used a relationship matrix based on both pedigree and genomic information (single-step approach). The third analysis used the complete data set and only the pedigree-based relationship matrix. The fourth analysis used predictions from the first analysis (final scores up to 2004 and only a pedigree-based relationship matrix) and prediction using a genomic based matrix to obtain genetic evaluation (multiple-step approach). Different allele frequencies were tested in construction of the genomic relationship matrix. Coefficients of determination between predictions of young bulls from parent average, single-step, and multiple-step approaches and their 2009 daughter deviations were 0.24, 0.37 to 0.41, and 0.40, respectively. The highest coefficient of determination for a single-step approach was observed when using a genomic relationship matrix with assumed allele frequencies of 0.5. Coefficients for regression of 2009 daughter deviations on parent-average, single-step, and multiple-step predictions were 0.76, 0.68 to 0.79, and 0.86, respectively, which indicated some inflation of predictions. The single-step regression coefficient could be increased up to 0.92 by scaling differences between the genomic and pedigree-based relationship matrices with little loss in accuracy of prediction. One complete evaluation took about 2h of computing time and 2.7 gigabytes of memory. Computing times for single-step analyses were slightly longer (2{\%}) than for pedigree-based analysis. A national single-step genetic evaluation with the pedigree relationship matrix augmented with genomic information provided genomic predictions with accuracy and bias comparable to multiple-step procedures and could account for any population or data structure. Advantages of single-step evaluations should increase in the future when animals are pre-selected on genotypes.},

We recently showed that cows experiencing SARA and challenged intramammarily with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) experienced stronger metabolic disturbances compared with cows without SARA. Therefore, we hypothesized that cows experiencing SARA have a modulated innate immune response and impaired plasma metabolome compared with healthy cows when experiencing an acute mastitis challenge. A total of 18 Simmental cows were subjected either to a Control (CON, n =6) or SARA ( n= 12) feeding regimen, receiving either 40{\%} or 60{\%} concentrates for 30 days. Thereafter, six SARA (SARA-LPS) and the CON (CON-LPS) cows were intramammarily challenged with 50 µg LPS from Escherichia coli (O26 : B6), while the remaining six SARA cows (SARA-PLA) received a placebo. Blood and milk samples were analyzed for acute phase proteins and a targeted ESI-LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics approach was performed in blood samples 24 h after the LPS challenge. The LPS infusion caused a strong increase in immune response variables, with a higher concentration of milk amyloid A 48 h after the LPS challenge in SARA-LPS compared with CON-LPS cows. Cows receiving the LPS infusion had a lower plasma concentration of several amino acids and lysophosphatidylcholines but without differences in SARA cows and healthy cows. In conclusion, our results revealed that an intramammary LPS infusion increased acute phase proteins and modulated the blood metabolome. While no systemic differences between SARA and healthy cows were observed, cows experiencing SARA showed a higher concentration of an acute phase protein at the local level of the mammary gland. Further research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to evaluate its clinical significance for udder health.},

the {\{}PS{\}} of {\{}AH{\}} and the inclusion of {\{}SH{\}} in the diets ({\{}P{\}}�{\textless}�0.01).
{\{}I{\}}ntake of pe{\{}NDF{\}} was increased by increasing the {\{}PS{\}} of {\{}AH{\}}

abstract = { Parent-of-origin gene expression (genomic
imprinting) is widespread among eutherian mammals
and also occurs in marsupials. Most imprinted genes
are expressed in the placenta, but the brain is also
a favored site. Although imprinting evolved in
therian mammals before the marsupial-eutherian
split, the mechanisms have continued to evolve in
each lineage to produce differences between the two
groups in terms of the number and regulation of
imprinted genes. As yet there is no evidence for
genomic imprinting in the egg-laying monotreme
mammals, although these mammals also form a placenta
(albeit short-lived) and transfer nutrients from

essential for the evolution of the placenta and its
importance in nutrient transfer but the elaboration
of imprinted genes in marsupials and eutherians is
associated with viviparity. Here we review the
recent analyses of imprinted gene clusters in
marsupials and monotremes, which have served to shed
light on the origin and evolution of imprinting

abstract = {A meta-analysis of studies using the flux/compartmental pool method with indigestible neutral detergent fiber (iNDF) as internal marker was conducted to study the effect of extrinsic characteristics and forage type on particle passage rate (k(p)) in cattle. Further, the k(p) prediction equations in the National Research Council (NRC) and the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) were evaluated. Data comprised 172 treatment means from 49 studies conducted in Europe and the United States. In total, 145 diets were fed to dairy cows and 27 to growing cattle. A prerequisite for inclusion of an experiment was that dry matter intake, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), proportion of concentrate in the diet, body weight, and diet chemical composition were determined or could be estimated. Mixed model regression analysis including a random study effect was used to generate prediction equations of k(p) and to investigate the relationships between NRC and CNCPS predictions and observed k(p) of iNDF. Prediction equations were evaluated by regressing residual values on the predicted values. The best-fit model when forage type was not included was k(p) ({\%}/h) = 1.19+0.0879 × NDF intake (g/kg of body weight)+0.792 × proportion of concentrate NDF of total NDF+1.21 × diet iNDF:NDF ratio (adjusted residual mean square error = 0.23{\%}/h). The best general equation accounting for an effect of forage type was as follows: k(p) ({\%}/h) = F+1.54+0.0866 × NDF intake (g/kg of body weight) (adjusted residual mean square error = 0.21{\%}/h), where F is the forage adjustment factor of the intercept. The value of F for grass silage, fresh grass, mixes of alfalfa and corn silage, and dry or ensiled alfalfa as sole forage component were 0.00, -0.91, +0.83, and +0.24, respectively. Relationships between predicted and observed k(p) were y = 0.53(± 0.187)+0.41( ± 0.0373) × predicted k(p) and y = 0.58(± 0.162)+0.46(± 0.0377) × predicted k(p) for the NRC and CNCPS models, respectively. Residual analysis of the NRC and CNCPS models resulted in both significant mean biases (observed--predicted) of -2.40 and -1.70{\%} and linear biases of -0.59 and -0.53, respectively. The results from this meta-analysis suggest that ruminal particulate matter k(p) is affected by forage type in the diet. Further, the evaluation of NRC and CNCPS models showed that passage rate equations developed from marker excretion curves markedly deviated from observed k(p) of iNDF derived using the rumen evacuation technique.},

A particular form of nonrandom mating occurs when parental individuals of opposite sex originate from distinct populations. In animal breeding this is called crossbreeding and hybridization in plant breeding. In these situations, association between marker and putative gene alleles might differ between the founding populations and origin of alleles should be accounted for in studies which estimate breeding values with marker data. The sequence of alleles from one parent constitutes one haplotype of an individual. Haplotypes thus reveal allele origin in data of crossbred individuals.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary P concentrations of 0.37 (recommended) or 0.57{\%} (excess; dry matter basis) on reproductive performance. At calving, Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments (n = 134 for 0.37{\%} P and n = 133 for 0.57{\%} P). Cows were fitted with a radiotelemetric transmitter (50 d in milk DIM) to record mounting activity during estrus and bred to natural estrus from 50 to 100 DIM, then to synchronized estrus (Ovsynch protocol) after 100 DIM. Weekly ultrasonography was performed from 50 DIM until pregnancy was diagnosed (-30 d after artificial insemination). Pregnancy was confirmed approximately 60 d after artificial insemination (artificial insemination). Weekly blood samples were analyzed for progesterone concentrations. Days to first increase ({\textgreater}1 ng/ml) in progesterone, days to first estrus detected by radiotelemetry, days to first service detected by herd personnel, and conception rate at first service did not differ between the recommended and excess P groups, respectively. Similarly, conception rate at 30 d, days open, pregnancies lost from 30 to 60 d, multiple ovulation rate, and the incidence of anovulatory condition at 71 DIM did not differ between these groups. The mean duration of estrus was 8.7 0.5 and 8.7 0.7 h, and the average number of mounts per estrus was 7.4 0.5 and 7.8 0.5 for a total mounting time during estrus of 25.8 1.8 and 24.5 1.6 s for cows fed the recommended and excess P diet, respectively.

abstract = {
A feeding regimen that allows a smooth transition from milk to solid feed is vital for successful heifer-rearing programs. In the past, research efforts have focused on the development of feeding methods that allow early weaning, perhaps because the risk of disease is highest during the milk feeding stage. To encourage early intake of calf starter, conventional feeding programs have limited the supply of milk (often to 10{\%} of BW at birth). However, dairy calves provided free access to milk will typically consume more than twice this amount. We critically review the available literature examining the relationship between milk feeding method, solid feed consumption, and rumen development in young dairy calves and identify areas where new work is required. We conclude that milk-fed dairy calves can safely ingest milk at approximately 20{\%} of body weight (BW)/d, and greater milk consumption supports greater BW gain, improved feed efficiency, reduced incidence of disease, and greater opportunity to express natural behaviors, which in combination suggest improved welfare. Method of weaning greatly influences feed consumption, rumen development, and growth check in calves provided higher amounts of milk. Gradual weaning encourages starter intake during the preweaning period, and both weaning age and duration of weaning influence this consumption. Increased solid feed consumption during the weaning process contributes to rumen development, permitting higher starter intake and BW gain after weaning. Growth factors in milk may also enhance the growth and maturation of the gastrointestinal tract, but more research is required to understand the role of these factors. Greater nutrient supply through increased amount of milk appears to improve immune function and long-term performance of heifer calves; for example, reducing the age at first breeding and increasing first-lactation milk yield, but more research is needed to confirm these effects.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Dairy Science Association. The objectives of the experiment were to evaluate the effects of feeding diets with distinct dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) levels and supplemented with 2 sources of vitamin D during the prepartum transition period on postpartum health and reproduction in dairy cows. The hypotheses were that feeding acidogenic diets prepartum would reduce the risk of hypocalcemia and other diseases, and the benefits of a negative DCAD treatment on health would be potentiated by supplementing calcidiol compared with cholecalciferol. Cows at 252 d of gestation were blocked by parity (28 nulliparous and 52 parous cows) and milk yield within parous cows, and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial, with 2 levels of DCAD, positive (+130 mEq/kg) or negative (-130 mEq/kg), and 2 sources of vitamin D, cholecalciferol or calcidiol, fed at 3 mg for each 11 kg of diet dry matter. The resulting treatment combinations were positive DCAD with cholecalciferol (PCH), positive DCAD with calcidiol (PCA), negative DCAD with cholecalciferol (NCH), and negative DCAD with calcidiol (NCA), which were fed from 252 d of gestation to calving. After calving, cows were fed the same lactation diet supplemented with cholecalciferol at 0.70 mg for every 20 kg of dry matter. Blood was sampled 7 d before parturition, and at 2 and 7 d postpartum to evaluate cell counts and measures of neutrophil function. Postpartum clinical and subclinical diseases and reproductive responses were evaluated. Feeding a diet with negative DCAD eliminated clinical hypocalcemia (23.1 vs. 0{\%}) and drastically reduced the incidence and daily risk of subclinical hypocalcemia, and these effects were observed in the first 48 to 72 h after calving. The diet with negative DCAD tended to improve the intensity of oxidative burst activity of neutrophils in all cows prepartum and increased the intensity of phagocytosis in parous cows prepartum and the proportion of neutrophils with killing activity in parous cows postpartum (58.5 vs. 67.6{\%}). Feeding calcidiol improved the proportion of neutrophils with oxidative burst activity (60.0 vs. 68.7{\%}), reduced the incidences of retained placenta (30.8 vs. 2.5{\%}) and metritis (46.2 vs. 23.1{\%}), and reduced the proportion of cows with multiple diseases in early lactation. Combining the negative DCAD diet with calcidiol reduced morbidity by at least 60{\%} compared with any of the other treatments. Cows with morbidity had lower blood ionized Ca and serum total Ca concentrations than healthy cows. Treatments did not affect the daily risk of hyperketonemia in the first 30 d of lactation. Despite the changes in cow health, manipulating the prepartum DCAD did not influence reproduction, but feeding calcidiol tended to increase the rate of pregnancy by 55{\%}, which reduced the median days open by 19. In conclusion, feeding prepartum cows with a diet containing a negative DCAD combined with 3 mg of calcidiol benefited health in early lactation.},

abstract = {Freestall housing for dairy cows has many different layouts and the space allocated for cows differs considerably. The objective of the present study was to investigate possible associations between barn layout and milk yield for different parities in small dairy freestall barns. Layouts of 204 Norwegian freestall barns constructed during the period from 1995 to 2005, and with a mean herd size of 42.7±15.5 cows, were obtained and merged with milk yield data and calving interval, for each parity, from the Norwegian Milk Recording System (NDHRS). The milk yield data set contained 20,221 different lactations from these 204 herds. Both simple mixed models, including the different explanatory variables one by one together with parity, calving interval, and herd as random effect, and a final mixed model, including all significant explanatory variables, were created. According to variables tested in this study, the final mixed model estimates show that only primiparous cows benefit significantly from increased free space allocation. Milk yield was generally higher in automatic milking system barns compared with that in barns with milking parlors, but not for primiparous cows. Milk yield was higher for all parities for barns using separation pens in accordance with the recommendations. Barns with 2 or more dead-end alleys had lower milk yield compared with that from layouts without dead-end alleys. Primiparous cows benefited from water troughs located for easy access and responded with increased milk yield. In 10{\%} of the barns, the water trough capacity was less than 47{\%} of the recommendations, and all parities benefited from a water trough capacity higher than this level. Higher parities had increased milk yield when water trough capacity was more than 80{\%}. Feed bunk space, number of freestall rows, and the location of freestalls had no significant effect on the milk yield. The present study showed that increased space and improved access to water is beneficial to primiparous cows, whereas layouts without dead-end alleys and improved water capacity is beneficial for all cows in freestall systems.},

However, accurately measuring nutrient digestibility and using digestion values in total digestible nutrients models is more challenging. Our objective was to determine if in vivo apparent total-tract nutrient digestibility measured with a practical approach was related to commercial milk production parameters. Total mixed ration and fecal samples were collected from high-producing cows in pens on 39 commercial dairies and analyzed at a commercial feed and forage testing laboratory for nutrient concentration and 120-h indigestible NDF (iNDF) content using the Combs-Goeser in vitro digestion technique. The 120-h iNDF was used as an internal marker to calculate in vivo apparent nutrient digestibilities. Two samples were taken from each dairy and were separated in time by at least 3 wk. Samples were targeted to be taken within 7d of Dairy Herd Improvement (DHI) herd testing. Approved DHI testers measured individual cow milk weights as well as fat and protein concentrations. Individual cow records were averaged by pen corresponding to the total mixed ration and fecal samples. Formulated diet and dry matter intake (DMI) records for each respective pen were also collected. Mixed model regression analysis with dairy specified as a random effect was used to relate explanatory variables (diet nutrient concentrations, formulated DMI, in vivo apparent nutrient digestibilities, and fecal nutrient concentrations) to milk production measures. Dry matter intake, organic matter (OM) digestibility, fecal crude protein (CP) concentration, and fecal ether extract concentration were related to milk, energy-corrected milk, and fat yields. Milk protein concentration was related to CP digestibility, and milk protein yield was related to DMI, OM digestibility, CP digestibility, and ether extract digestibility. Although many studies have related DMI and OM digestibility to milk production under controlled experimental settings, very few have related practical in vivo measures to milk production. By documenting the practical OM digestibility relationship with milk production, nutritionists and scientists may have confidence in this approach for measuring diet performance and collecting nutritional data for commercial dairies.},

abstract = {The effect of exogenous phytase on inositol phosphate degradation in the rumen of dairy cows was investigated in a 4×4 Latin square design. Four lactating Danish Holstein cows fitted with ruminal, duodenal, and ileal cannulas were offered a total mixed ration (TMR) with a high content of inositol phosphate and supplemented with 1 of 4 concentrations of phytase [none, low, medium, or high, corresponding to 23, 2,023, 3,982, and 6,015 phytase units/kg of dry matter (DM)]. Exogenous phytase lead to a higher rumen pool of phytase. Inositol phosphate content in digesta samples from rumen, duodenum, ileum, and feces was almost entirely composed of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)), indicating that degradation of this compound is the rate-limiting step in inositol phosphate degradation in the digestive tract. Ruminal and total-tract degradations of InsP(6) were higher when exogenous phytase was added to the TMR. Degradation of InsP(6) occurred mainly before the duodenum. The ruminal degradability of InsP(6) was increased with increasing dietary concentrations of phytase: 86.4, 93.7, 94.5, and 96.3{\%} for none, low, medium, or high, respectively. A comparison of the InsP(6) content in individual feedstuffs and in samples of the TMR revealed that the exogenous phytase started degrading the inositol phosphate when feeds and phytase were mixed, and thus the InsP(6) phosphorus (InsP(6)-P) content in the TMR was found to decrease with higher doses of phytase (1.69, 1.51, 1.39, and 1.25g/kg of DM for the none, low, medium, and high phytase doses, respectively). It was not possible to distinguish between the degradation of inositol phosphate occurring in the TMR and in the rumen. Exogenous phytase had no effect on total P intake or flow of total P to the duodenum and ileum, whereas exogenous phytase increased flow of microbial P to the duodenum and total fecal P excretion. None of the investigated rumen variables (pH, degradability of neutral detergent fiber, and rumen kinetics for neutral detergent fiber) were affected by treatment. Rumen and total-tract degradations of inositol phosphate were increased when exogenous phytase was added to the TMR, which offers the potential for reducing P excretion through reduced dietary P.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare circulating progesterone (P4) profiles and pregnancies per AI (P/AI) in lactating dairy cows bred by timed artificial insemination (TAI) following Ovsynch-56 after 2 different presynchronization protocols: Double-Ovsynch (DO) or Presynch-Ovsynch (PS). Our main hypothesis was that DO would increase fertility in primiparous cows, but not in multiparous cows. Within each herd (n = 3), lactating dairy cows (n = 1,687; 778 primiparous, 909 multiparous) were randomly assigned to DO [n = 837; GnRH-7d-PGF(2$\alpha$)-3d-GnRH-7d-Ovsynch-56 (GnRH-7d-PGF(2$\alpha$)-56h-GnRH-16hTAI)] or PS (n = 850; PGF(2$\alpha$)-14d-PGF(2$\alpha$)-12d-Ovsynch-56). In 1 herd, concentrations of P4 were determined at the first GnRH (GnRH1) of Ovsynch-56 and at d 11 after TAI (n = 739). In all herds, pregnancy was diagnosed by palpation per rectum at 39 d. In 1 herd, the incidence of late embryo loss was determined at 74 d, and data were available on P/AI at the subsequent second service. Presynchronization with DO reduced the percentage of animals with low P4 concentrations ({\textless}0.50 ng/mL) at GnRH1 of Ovsynch-56 (5.4 vs. 25.3{\%}, DO vs. PS). A lesser percentage of both primiparous and multiparous cows treated with DO had low P4 concentrations at GnRH1 of Ovsynch-56 (3.3 vs. 19.7{\%}, DO vs. PS primiparous; and 8.8 vs. 31.9{\%}, DO vs. PS multiparous). Presynchronization with DO improved P/AI at the first postpartum service (46.3 vs. 38.2{\%}, DO vs. PS). Statistically, a fertility improvement could be detected for primiparous cows treated with DO (52.5 vs. 42.3{\%}, DO vs. PS, primiparous), but only a tendency could be detected in multiparous cows (40.3 vs. 34.3{\%}, DO vs. PS, multiparous), consistent with our original hypothesis. Presynchronization treatment had no effect on the incidence of late embryo loss after first service (8.5 vs. 5.5{\%}, DO vs. PS). A lower body condition score increased the percentage of cows with low P4 at GnRH1 of Ovsynch-56 and reduced fertility to the TAI. In addition, P4 concentration at d 11 after TAI was reduced by DO. The method of presynchronization at first service had no effect on P/AI at the subsequent second service (34.7 vs. 36.5{\%}, DO vs. PS). Thus, presynchronization with DO induced cyclicity in most anovular cows and improved fertility compared with PS, suggesting that DO could be a useful reproductive management protocol for synchronizing first service in commercial dairy herds.},

abstract = {A total of 57 trials using 164 different diets in which measurements were made of lactational responses of dairy cows to postruminal supplements of lysine and methionine, were analysed. Duodenal flow of digestible lysine (LysDI) and methionine (MetDI) was estimated and expressed in relative terms ({\%}PDI). To allow inter-trial comparison which would have been invalidated by large differences between control treatments in LysDI and MetDI, milk production responses in terms of total yield, protein yield and content, fat yield and content, were expressed relative to new reference values calculated for the LysDI and MetDI concentrations (7.0 and 2.1{\%} PDI, respectively), common for all analysed trials. Milk protein yield responses (dPY, g/d) were described by the following equation derived for lysine (LysDI): dPY=21.0{\{}1-exp[-1.15(LysDI-7.0)]{\}} R(2)=0.87, RSD=21.0, n=63 The equation describing responses to methionine (MetDI) was calculated for concurrent lysine concentrations greater than 6.5{\%}PDI: dPY=34.1{\{}1-exp[-1.90(MetDI-2.1)]{\}} R(2)=0.81, RSD=11.7, n=37 The relationships obtained for protein yield could be used consequently to determine lysine (7.3 LysDI) and methionine (2.5 MetDI) allowances ({\%}PDI), which optimise milk protein secretion in dairy cows and which conform to standard production conditions. The validity of the present approach as well as its strengths and weaknesses are discussed. The present values were compared with those obtained by either direct physiological or indirect factorial methods.},

abstract = {The effect of three wheat grain treatments on the zootechnical performance (feed intake, milk production and milk fat and protein production) of dairy cattle was studied with 18 Holstein cows in each of two feeding trials (both a 3 ?? 3 Latin square design). Rolled wheat, NaOH treated wheat and immature wheat ensiled with Graintona-Plus (Vee-lik, Zuienkerke, Belgium) were compared in a ration with fixed DM proportions of wheat, maize silage and prewilted grass silage. The nutritive value of the three wheat treatments was derived from in situ rumen degradability studies and from in vivo digestibility experiments. In situ rumen incubations showed that NaOH treatment strongly decreased protein and starch degradability of the wheat. Due to that importantly decreased starch degradability NaOH treated wheat may be a source of starch with a reduced risk of rumen acidosis as compared to rolled wheat. On the other hand, due to the ensiling, immature wheat had a very high washable starch fraction, despite the Graintona-Plus treatment. The protein value differed importantly, with the DPI (true protein digested in the small intestine; [Tamminga, S., van Straalen, W.M., Subnel, A.P.J., Meijer, R.G.M., Steg, A., Wever, C.J.G., Blok, M.C., 1994. The Dutch protein evaluation system: the DVE/OEB-system. Livest. Prod. Sci. 40, 139-155]) value being 103, 125 and 76 g/kg DM for rolled, NaOH treated and ensiled wheat, respectively.

The Dutch protein evaluation system: the DVE/OEB-system. Livest. Prod. Sci. 40, 139-155]) value of the NaOH treated wheat was - 51 vs. - 37 and- 33 g/kg DM for rolled and ensiled wheat. In vivo digestibility trials with Holstein cows indicated that the net energy value of the wheat treatments was not significantly different. In Trial 1, all diets were formulated to supply 105{\%} of the requirements of DPI and net energy lactation (NEL; [Van Es, A.J.H., 1978. Feed evaluation for ruminants: I. The system in use from May 1977 onwards in the Netherlands. Livest. Prod. Sci. 5, 331-345]) and a safe RDPB level (?? 200 g/day). On average 4.6 kg wheat DM was fed daily. Following trial 1, trial 2 was carried out, with the maize silage, grass silage and wheat fed in the same proportions as in trial 1, but fed ad libitum, to compare the intake level of the three diets. In both trials, the NaOH treated wheat resulted in the best performance with importantly increased milk yield and the highest yield of fat and protein corrected milk. Ensiled immature wheat resulted in a significant lower milk production and milk protein yield and in a higher milk fat content. In trial 1, DM-intake of the three groups was comparable due to the experimental design. In trial 2 intake of the cows fed NaOH treated wheat was significantly higher (23.5 vs. 21.1 kg/day for the other two groups). ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Forages are usually inoculated with homofermentative and facultative heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to enhance lactic acid fermentation of forages, but effects of such inoculants on silage quality and the performance of dairy cows are unclear. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effects of LAB inoculation on silage quality and preservation and the performance of dairy cows. A second objective was to examine the factors affecting the response to silage inoculation with LAB. The studies that met the selection criteria included 130 articles that examined the effects of LAB inoculation on silage quality and 31 articles that investigated dairy cow performance responses. The magnitude of the effect (effect size) was evaluated using raw mean differences (RMD) between inoculated and uninoculated treatments. Heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression and subgroup analysis using forage type, LAB species, LAB application rate, and silo scale (laboratory or farm-scale) as covariates for the silage quality response and forage type, LAB species, diet type [total mixed ration (TMR) or non-TMR], and the level of milk yield of the control cows as covariates for the performance responses. Inoculation with LAB (≥105 cfu/g as fed) markedly increased silage fermentation and dry matter recovery in temperate and tropical grasses, alfalfa, and other legumes. However, inoculation did not improve the fermentation of corn, sorghum, or sugarcane silages. Inoculation with LAB reduced clostridia and mold growth, butyric acid production, and ammonia-nitrogen in all silages, but it had no effect on aerobic stability. Silage inoculation (≥105 cfu/g as fed) increased milk yield and the response had low heterogeneity. However, inoculation had no effect on diet digestibility and feed efficiency. Inoculation with LAB improved the fermentation of grass and legume silages and the performance of dairy cows but did not affect the fermentation of corn, sorghum, and sugar cane silages or the aerobic stability of any silage. Further research is needed to elucidate how silage inoculated with homofermentative and facultative heterofermentative LAB improves the performance of dairy cows.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of a digital Brix refractometer for the assessment of success of passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulin compared with the measurement of serum total protein (STP) by refractometry. Blood samples (n=400) were collected from calves at 3 to 6d of age. Serum IgG concentration was determined by radial immunodiffusion (RID), and STP and percentage Brix ({\%}Brix) were determined using a digital refractometer. The mean IgG concentration was 24.1g/L [standard deviation (SD) ± 10.0] with a range from 2.1 to 59.1g/L. The mean STP concentration was 6.0g/dL (SD ± 0.8) with a range from 4.4 to 8.8g/dL. The mean {\%}Brix concentration was 9.2{\%} (SD ± 0.9) with a range of 7.3 to 12.4{\%}. Brix percentage was highly correlated with IgG (r=0.93). Test characteristics were calculated to assess failure of passive transfer (FPT; serum IgG {\textless}10g/L). The sensitivity and specificity of STP at 5.5g/dL were 76.3 and 94.4{\%}, respectively. A receiver operating characteristic curve was created to plot the true positive rate against the false positive rate for consecutive {\%}Brix values. The optimal combination of sensitivity (88.9{\%}) and specificity (88.9{\%}) was at 8.4{\%} Brix. Serum total protein was also positively correlated with {\%}Brix (r=1.00) and IgG (r=0.93). Dairy producers can successfully monitor their colostrum management and the overall success of passive transfer using a digital Brix refractometer to estimate IgG concentration of colostrum and calf serum.},

abstract = {The objective of this investigation was to determine associations among rumen endotoxin, plasma serum amyloid A (SAA), and C-reactive protein (CRP) with plasma Ca, Fe, Zn, and Cu in lactating cows challenged with graded amounts of rolled barley grain in the diet (i.e., 0, 15, 30, and 45{\%} of DMI). Correlative relationships among variables were determined by linear and nonlinear regression procedures adjusted for the effects of day, animal, and experimental period. Increasing the amount of grain in the diet was successful in inducing an acute phase response, as assessed by augmentation of rumen endotoxin and plasma CRP and SAA (P {\textless} 0.01). The correlative analysis revealed inverse, nonlinear relationships of rumen endotoxin and plasma SAA with circulating Ca. Interestingly, plasma Ca reached the asymptotic plateau at 10.6 mg/dL. The increase in rumen endotoxin was associated with an abrupt decrease in plasma Fe (R(2) = 0.91; P {\textless} 0.001). A similar relationship, although at a reduced estimation accuracy (R(2) = 0.21; P {\textless} 0.01), was observed between rumen endotoxin and plasma Zn. Augmentation of rumen endotoxin and plasma CRP resulted in a positive, biphasic response of plasma Cu. In conclusion, the increase in rumen endotoxin in response to high-grain diets, and the resulting increases in plasma SAA and CRP, were strongly correlated with fluctuations of plasma minerals. Results suggest that new feeding strategies should be developed to curb the release of endotoxin in the rumen fluid to prevent perturbing minerals in the plasma.},

abstract = {Effective functionality of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and its health, are important factors in determining animal performance. Several, complex mechanisms are involved in the regulation of GIT functionality and health, therefore it is crucial to deepen our knowledge of these interactions so that strategies for the modulation of GIT functionality and health, in context of improved animal performance, can be developed. The concept of “gut health” has started to attract significant interest within the animal science community, however a clear definition of gastrointestinal health and functionality and how it can be measured is lacking. Therefore, this review will present a new definition of gastrointestinal functionality and will address how optimal gastrointestinal functionality can promote animal performances and welfare. The key components of gastrointestinal functionality reviewed in this article are: diet, effective structure and function of the gastrointestinal barrier, host interaction with the gastrointestinal microbiota, effective digestion and absorption of feed and effective immune status. While the relationships between these areas is extremely complex, a multidisciplinary approach is needed to develop nutritional strategies that would allow farm animals to become more resilient to the environmental and physiological challenges that they will have to endure during their productive career. As the demand of animal products from the rapidly growing world human population is ever-growing, the aim of this review is to present animal and veterinary scientists and nutritionists, a new definition of gastrointestinal functionality that can be used to establish a multidisciplinary approach to increase animal health, welfare and performance.},

abstract = {The objective was to evaluate whether the amount of concentrate offered in an automatic milking systems (AMS) would modify milking frequency, feeding behavior, and milk production. One hundred fifteen lactating cows were used in a cross-over design with 2 periods of 90 d each and 2 treatments: low concentrate (LC; up to 3 kg/d of concentrate at the AMS) or high concentrate (HC; up to 8 kg/d of concentrate at the AMS). Cows were evenly distributed in 2 symmetrical pens, each containing 1 AMS and about 50 cows at any given time. All cows received the same total ration (28{\%} corn silage, 1.67 Mcal of net energy for lactation/kg, 16.5{\%} crude protein, DM basis), but a different amount of concentrate from this ration was offered at the AMS depending on treatment. The concentrate at the AMS had the same composition in both treatments. Cows were fetched when time elapsed, because last milking was greater than 12 h. The amount of concentrate offered at the AMS was proportional to the time elapsed since last visit (125 and 333 g/h for LC and HC, respectively). Milk production, total number of daily milkings, number of cows fetched, or number of voluntary milkings were not affected by treatments. The consumption of basal ration was greater in LC than in HC, but this difference was compensated by a greater consumption of concentrate at the AMS in HC than LC cows. Total dry matter intake tended to be lower, therefore, in HC than in LC cows. Eating rate of the basal ration was greater in LC than in HC, but the total amount of time that cows devoted to eat was similar between treatments. Offering high amounts of concentrate to the AMS feeding a basal ration rich in corn silage did not diminish the need for fetching cows and did not increase the number of daily milkings nor milk production.},

abstract = {Non-coeliac/non-allergic gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCG/WS) is a gluten-related disorder, the pathogenesis of which remains unclear. Recently, the involvement of an increased intestinal permeability has been recognized in the onset of this clinical condition. However, mechanisms through which it takes place are still unclear. In this review, we attempt to uncover these mechanisms by providing, for the first time, an integrated vision of recent scientific literature, resulting in a new hypothesis about the pathogenic mechanisms involved in NCG/WS. According to this, the root cause of NCG/WS is a particular dysbiotic profile characterized by decreased butyrate-producing-Firmicutes and/or Bifidobacteria, leading to low levels of intestinal butyrate. Beyond a critical threshold of the latter, a chain reaction of events and vicious circles occurs, involving other protagonists such as microbial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) and wheat $\alpha$-amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs). NCG/WS is likely to be a multi-factor-onset disorder, probably transient and preventable, related to quality and balance of the diet, and not to the presence of gluten in itself. If future studies confirm our proposal, this would have important implications both for the definition of the disease, as well as for the prevention and therapeutic-nutritional management of individuals with NCG/WS.},

abstract = {In genetic mapping of complex traits, scored haplotypes are likely to represent only a subset of all causal polymorphisms. At the extreme of this scenario, observed polymorphisms are not themselves functional, and only linked to causal ones via linkage disequilibrium (LD). We will demonstrate that due to such incomplete knowledge regarding the underlying genetic mechanism, the variance of a trait may become different between the scored haplotypes. Thus, unequal variances between haplotypes may be indicative of additional functional polymorphisms affecting the trait. Methods accounting for such haplotype-specific variance may also provide an increased power to detect complex associations. We suggest ways to estimate and test these haplotypic variance contrasts, and incorporate them into the haplotypic tests for association. We further extend this approach to data with unknown gametic phase via likelihood-based simultaneous estimation of haplotypic effects and their frequencies. We find our approach to provide additional power, especially under the following types of models: (a) where scored and unobserved variants are epistatically interacting with each other; and (b) under heterogeneity models, where multiple unobserved mutations are linked to non-functional observed polymorphisms via LD. An illustrative example of usefulness of the method is discussed, utilizing analysis of multilocus effects within the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene.},

The effects of the level of energy intake (high E and low E) offered before and after calving on body condition score at calving, production performance, and energy status in the first 250 d of lactation were evaluated in a 2 × 2 factorial design experiment involving 80 Holstein-Friesian dairy animals (40 primiparous and 40 multiparous). From d 80 until d 21 precalving, primiparous animals were offered either high or low pasture allowances. Thereafter, these animals were housed and had ad libitum access to a high energy density diet (high E) or restricted access [6 kg of dry matter (DM) per d] to a low energy density diet (low E), respectively, until calving. From d 100 until d 42 precalving, multiparous animals were offered either ad libitum or restricted (10 kg of DM/d) access to a late lactation diet, and thereafter, had ad libitum access to a high E diet or restricted access (7 kg of DM complete diet/d) to a low E diet, respectively, until calving. The forage to concentrate (F:C) ratios (DM basis) of these high E and low E diets [d 42 (d 21 in primiparous animals) until calving] were 64:36 and 83:17, respectively. Cows offered high E and low E precalving diets were allocated to either a high E or low E postcalving diet [F:C ratio (DM basis) of 30:70 and 70:30, respectively] and remained on these diets until d 250 of lactation. Multiparous animals offered a high E diet precalving had a significantly higher body condition score at calving than those offered the low E diet precalving. This effect was not evident in primiparous animals. Precalving diet had no significant effect on plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations during the last 3 wk precalving in primi- or multiparous animals. Primiparous animals offered a high E diet precalving had significantly higher postcalving plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acid, suggesting greater mobilization of body reserves. Primi- and multiparous animals offered a high E diet postcalving had a significantly higher dry matter intake, milk yield, and energy status postcalving compared with animals offered a low E diet postcalving. Milk yields of primiparous animals offered high E and low E diets postcalving were 29.7 and 24.8 kg/d, respectively, and milk yield of multiparous animals offered high E and low E diets postcalving were 33.5 and 28.2 kg/d, respectively. It is concluded that altering body condition score during the dry period is difficult but that specific dietary regimens applied precalving can have a significant influence on postcalving production and energy-related parameters.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate intra- and inter-observer agreement and accuracy of a simple method to score DD lesions that is based on the inspection of cleaned feet in the milking parlor with a swiveling mirror and a powerful headlamp. The hind feet of 242 Holstein cows from 4 farms were inspected concurrently by 5 observers (to assess inter-observer agreement) during 2 consecutive milkings (to assess intra-observer agreement). This inspection was followed by an inspection of the feet in a trimming chute, considered to be the gold standard test, to test for accuracy. The reliability of the method was assessed using both the 5 M-stages scoring system (M0 to M4, M standing for Mortellaro) and a simplified M-stages scoring system in which the M3 and M4 stages are merged. As most disagreements concerned the M3 and M4 stages, performance was improved with the simplified M-stages scoring system. With this simplified system, the method had good intra-observer agreement [percent of overall raw agreement (PA)=80{\%}, weighted kappa ($\kappa$(w))=0.71, and good inter-observer agreement (PA=77{\%}, $\kappa$(w)=0.66)]. The agreement with the gold standard test was moderate (PA=69{\%}, $\kappa$(w)=0.58). Considering absence versus presence of a DD lesion on a foot, the method had good sensitivity (0.90) and specificity (0.80). The time spent for inspection varied from 30 to 60s per cow. Inspection of cleaned feet with a swiveling mirror and a powerful headlamp in the milking parlor is a reliable, cost- and time-friendly method, which may be useful for both farmers and researchers, especially when the DD status of many dairy cows has to be evaluated concomitantly. The reliability of this method might be improved by using more precise descriptive criteria for the discrimination of each M-stage.},

abstract = {Ration sorting is thought to affect ruminal fermentation in such a manner that milk yield milk and components are often decreased. However, the influence of ruminally degradable starch on ration sorting has not been studied. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to evaluate the interactions between forage particle size (FPS) and ruminally fermentable carbohydrates (RFC) for dry matter intake (DMI), ration sorting, ruminal fermentation, chewing activity, and milk yield and components. In this study, 12 (8 ruminally cannulated) multiparous, lactating Holstein cows were fed a total mixed ration that varied in FPS and RFC. Two lengths of corn silage were used to alter FPS and 2 grind sizes of corn grain were used to alter RFC. It was determined that increasing RFC increased ruminating time and did not affect eating time, whereas increasing FPS increased eating time and did not affect ruminating time. Ruminal fermentation did not differ by altering either FPS or RFC. However, increasing FPS tended to increase mean and maximum ruminal pH and increasing RFC tended to decrease minimum ruminal pH. Particle size distribution became more diverse and neutral detergent fiber content of refusals increased over time, whereas starch content decreased, indicating that cows were sorting against physically effective neutral detergent fiber and for RFC. Selection indices determined that virtually no interactions occurred between FPS and RFC and that despite significant sorting throughout the day, by 24 h after feeding cows had consumed a ration very similar to what was offered. This theory was reinforced by particle fraction intakes that very closely resembled the proportions of particle fractions in the offered total mixed ration. An interaction between FPS and RFC was observed for DMI, as DMI decreased with increasing FPS when the diet included low RFC and did not change when the diet included high RFC. Dry matter intake increased with RFC for long diets and did not change with RFC on short diets. Increasing RFC was found to increase milk yield, milk protein content and yield, and lactose content and yield but decrease milk fat content. Increasing FPS did not have as great an effect on milk production as RFC. This study found no significant interaction between FPS and RFC for ration sorting, although an interaction between FPS and RFC for DMI was observed. Neither FPS nor RFC affected ruminal fermentation, whereas RFC had a greater influence on milk yield and components than FPS.},

Twenty- four mid-lactation Holstein cows were used in split plot Latin square design. Cows were allocated to a main plot receiving either a basal diet without whole cottonseed (SH, n = 12) or a basal diet with whole cottonseed (CS, n = 12; 8{\%} diet DM). Within each plot a 4 × 4 Latin square arrangement of treat - ments was used in four consecutive 21-d periods. Fatty acid (FA) treatments were: 1) Control (CON; no supplemental fat); 2) C16:0 supplement (PA; {\~{}}80{\%} C16:0); 3) C16:0 and C18:0 supplement (PA+SA; {\~{}}40{\%} C16:0 + {\~{}}40{\%} C18:0); and 4) C16:0 and cis -9 C18:1 supplement (PA+OA; {\~{}}45{\%} C16:0 + {\~{}}35{\%} cis - C:) The final  d of each period were used for sample and data collection. The statistical model included the random effect of cow and the fixed effects of basal diet, FA treatment, period, and their interactions. Compared with SH diets, CS diets increased milk fat yield (1.71 vs. 1.51 kg/d; P = 0.05), yield of preformed milk FA (623 vs. 507 g/d; P {\textless} 0.01), and BW gain (1.0 vs. 0.71 kg/d; P = 0.04), tended to increase yield of de novo milk FA (396 vs. 383 g/d; P = 0.06), but re - duced NDF digestibility (41.9 vs. 46.4{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01) and total FA digestibility (74.2 vs. 76.3{\%} P = 0.05). Compared with other treatments, PA increased yield of milk fat (1.60, 1.70, 1.64 and 1.64 kg/d; P {\textless} 0.05) and 3.5{\%} FCM (45.2, 47.8, 46.8 and 46.5 kg/d; P {\textless} 0.01) for CON, PA, PA+SA and PA+OA, respectively. PA+OA increased BW gain compared with other treatments (0.82, 0.84, 0.70 and 1.05 kg/d; P {\textless} 0.05) for CON, PA, PA+SA and PA+OA, respectively. PA and PA+OA tended to increase NDF digestibility compared with PA+SA and CON (43.2, 44.9, 43.1 and 44.5{\%}; P {\textless} 0.10) for CON, PA, PA+SA and PA+OA, respectively. Compared with the other treatments, PA+SA reduced 16-carbon (77.6, 73.0, 66.0 and 79.1{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01), 18-carbon (79.2, 79.5, 72.0 and 79.7{\%}{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01), and total FA digestibility (78.6, 77.4, 68.2 and 79.4{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01) for CON, PA, PA+SA and PA+OA, respectively. In conclusion, diet inclusion of C16:0 increased energy out - put in milk, while inclusion cis -9 C18:1 increased BW gain. The combination of C16:0 and C18:0 reduced NDF and FA digestibilities, which likely explains its reduced performance compared with other treatments},

abstract = {Using dual outflow continuous fermenters, we have quantified the effects of two nitrogenous supplements on the degradation of ammonia-treated wheat straw by rumen microorganisms, and on the resulting microbial proteosynthesis. The two factors were (1) the amount of inorganic nitrogen supplied as a mixture of urea and ammonium sulfate (from 0 to 47 g CP kg-1 DM), (2) the amount of casein (from 0 to 52 g CP kg-1 DM). A Doehlert experimental design was applied and the responses were modeled using second-order polynomials. NH3-N concentration in the vessels was between 31.8 and 179.8 mg l-1 4 h after the meal, and was strongly increased by both nitrogenous supplements in a linear way. The addition of casein also increased the molar proportions of higher VFA. NDF and ADF degradabilities and OM true degradability averaged 56.4{\%}, 55.9{\%} and 57.7{\%}, respectively, and were not significantly influenced by any experimental factor. The partitioning of OM input into undegraded, fermented and microbial fractions was not significantly changed by experimental treatments. The outflows of non-ammonia N and microbial N were slightly increased by intermediate levels of N supplementation, leading to minor changes in the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis (mean: 21.9 g N kg-- OMF). As a conclusion, supplementing ammonia-treated wheat straw with inorganic nitrogen or casein up to a level of 50 g CP kg-1 DM did not induce significant changes in the utilisation of straw by rumen micro-organisms.},

abstract = {Twenty Holstein cows were used in a Latin square design experiment with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement to determine the effects of extruded flaxseed (EF) supplementation with 2 different forage to concentrate ratios on the performance of dairy cows. Extruded flaxseed diets contained 9{\%} (dry matter basis) EF product which consisted of 75{\%} EF and 25{\%} ground alfalfa meal. Four lactating Holsteins cows fitted with rumen fistulae were used to determine the effects of dietary treatments on ruminal fermentation. Intakes of dry matter and crude protein were not influenced by dietary treatments. However, neutral detergent fiber intake was greater for the high-forage (8.4 kg/d) than the low-forage (7.8 kg/d) diet. Milk yield (average 40.2 kg/d) was similar for all dietary treatments. However, cows fed the high-forage diets produced milk with higher fat (3.76 vs. 2.97{\%}) and total solids (12.58 vs. 11.95{\%}) concentrations, but lower protein (3.19 vs. 3.33{\%}) and lactose (4.66 vs. 4.72{\%}) contents. Ruminal pH and total volatile fatty acid concentration were not affected by dietary treatments. However, feeding high forage relative to low forage diets increased molar proportion of acetate but decreased that of propionate. Ruminal NH3-N was reduced by feeding high forage relative to low forage diets. Milk fatty acid composition was altered by both forage level and EF supplementation. Feeding diets containing EF or low forage reduced the concentrations of saturated fatty acids and increased those of mono-unsaturated fatty acids. Concentrations of poly-unsaturated fatty acids were increased by feeding EF or low-forage diets. Extruded flaxseed supplementation increased milk fat $\alpha$-linolenic acid content by 100{\%} and conjugated linoleic acid by 54{\%}. It was concluded that differences in animal performance and ruminal fermentation observed in this study were mostly due to differences in forage to concentrate ratio. However, EF supplementation caused most of the differences observed in milk fatty acid composition.},

abstract = {The economic damage that results from aerobic deterioration of silage is a significant problem for farm profitability and feed quality. This paper quantifies the dry matter (DM) and nutritional losses that occur during the exposure of corn and sorghum silages to air over 14 d and assesses the possibility of enhancing the aerobic stability of silages through inoculation with lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The trial was carried out in Northern Italy on corn (50{\%} milk line) and grain sorghum (early dough stage) silages. The crops were ensiled in 30-L jars, without a LAB inoculant (C), with a Lactobacillus plantarum inoculum (LP), and with a Lactobacillus buchneri inoculum (LB; theoretical rate of 1 × 10(6) cfu/g of fresh forage). The pre-ensiled material, the silage at silo opening, and the aerobically exposed silage were analyzed for DM content, fermentative profiles, yeast and mold count, starch, crude protein, ash, fiber components, 24-h and 48-h DM digestibility and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradability. The yield and nutrient analysis data of the corn and sorghum silages were used as input for Milk2006 to estimate the total digestible nutrients, net energy of lactation, and milk production per Mg of DM. The DM fermentation and respiration losses were also calculated. The inocula influenced the in vitro NDF digestibility at 24h, the net energy for lactation (NE(L)), and the predicted milk yield per megagram of DM, whereas the length of time of air exposure influenced DM digestibility at 24 and 48 h, the NE(L), and the predicted milk yield per megagram of DM in the corn silages. The inocula only influenced the milk yield per megagram of DM and the air exposure affected the DM digestibility at 24h, the NE(L), and the milk yield per megagram of DM in the sorghum silages. The milk yield, after 14 d of air exposure, decreased to 1,442, 1,418, and 1,277 kg/Mg of DM for C, LB, and LP corn silages, respectively, compared with an average value of 1,568 kg of silage at opening. In the sorghum silages, the milk yield, after 14 d of air exposure, decreased to 1,226, 1,278, and 1,250 kg/Mg of DM for C, LB, and LP, respectively. When the estimated milk yield per megagram of harvested DM of corn and sorghum silage were related to mold count, it was shown that the loss of potential milk production occurred when the mold count exceeded 4 log cfu/g of silage, and it was almost halved when the mold count reached values greater than 8 log cfu/g of silage. Inoculation with L. buchneri, at a rate of 1 × 10(6) cfu/g of fresh forage, enhanced the stability of the silage after exposure to air, and, consequently, contributed to maintaining the nutritional value of the harvested forage over time, for air exposure up to 7 d.},

Treatments were control, LCaP, MCaP and HCaP with 0, 100, 200 and 300 g calcium propionate per cow per day respectively. The supplement of food grade CaP (99.8{\%} of CaP) was hand-mixed into the top one-third of the daily ration. Cows were fed ad libitum a total mixed ration consisting of equal proportion of forage and concentrate. Feed intake, milk yield and components were not affected by CaP supplementation. The energy balance, expressed as the difference between energy input and output, tended to be higher (p = 0.08) for CaP-supplemented cows during the 63-DIM period, especially during the first 21-DIM lactation. Calcium propionate-supplemented cows showed a trend (p = 0.09) towards less loss of body weight (BW) during the 63-DIM period. Concentrations of glucose in plasma and insulin in serum were higher for cows fed CaP relative to control and linearly (p {\textless} 0.01) increased with increasing CaP supplementation. Concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and urine ketones were lower for CaP-supplemented cows at 7, 14 and 21 DIM of lactation and linearly (p {\textless} 0.01) decreased with increasing CaP supplementation. These results indicated that nutrient digestibilities and energy status may have been improved.},

abstract = {The aims of this study were to determine if feeding frequency (FF) of milk replacer (MR; meals/d) alters starter intake, growth, and efficiency of growth in nursery calves fed a conventional or accelerated MR. We hypothesized that smaller and more frequent MR meals would increase starter intake and growth when greater amounts of MR nutrients are fed to nursery calves. Forty-eight Holstein and Holstein-cross heifer and bull calves were assigned to treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of MR and FF. Treatments included (1) standard 20{\%} CP and 20{\%} fat MR fed at 1.5{\%} of body weight (BW; 2 meals/d; STD2), (2) standard 20{\%} CP and 20{\%} fat MR fed at 1.5{\%} of BW (4 meals/d; STD4), (3) modified 26{\%} CP and 18{\%} fat MR fed at 2.0{\%} of BW (2 meals/d; MOD2), and (4) modified 26{\%} CP and 18{\%} fat MR fed at 2.0{\%} of BW (4 meals/d; MOD4; n=12). All calves were fed at 0600 and 1700 h and STD4 and MOD4 calves were fed 2 additional meals at 1100 and 1400 h, resulting in the same amount of MR offered for the 2 × and 4 × treatments. Treatments were fed from d 2 to 42 of age and all MR feeding rates were adjusted weekly to maintain MR solids intakes at 1.5 or 2.0{\%} of BW for STD and MOD diets, respectively, and were reconstituted to 15{\%} total solids. Milk replacer FF was reduced by 50{\%} on d 36 and calves were weaned on d 42. Calves were housed in hutches bedded with straw and offered water and a texturized 18{\%} CP starter ad libitum. Calf body weight and body structure were measured weekly and starter intake and fecal scores were measured daily. Through both 42 and 56 d, calves fed MOD had greater CP and fat intake, resulting in increased average daily gain, heart girth, circulating nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and muscle total lipid compared with calves fed STD diets. Calves fed MOD diets consumed less starter grain than STD calves but total dry matter intake was similar among treatments. Increased FF for STD calves resulted in greater starter intake at weaning but increasing FF of MOD calves did not have this effect. Due to differences in starter intake, total dry matter by calves through d 56 was similar across treatments. Additionally, increased FF tended to increase serum NEFA concentrations. Serum NEFA concentration was negatively correlated with starter intake. The BW of calves fed STD2 and STD4 treatments almost doubled and the BW of calves on the MOD2 and MOD4 treatments doubled by d 56. Increased FF of the conventional MR program but not accelerated MR program increased starter intake. Increased FF did not affect growth, starter intake, or gain:feed ratio.},

In yr 1, chopped forage was treated with 1) no additive (untreated, U), 2) Lactobacillus buchneri 40788, 4 x 10(5) cfu/g of fresh forage (LLB4), 3) L. buchneri 11A44, 1 x 10(5) cfu/g (PLB), 4) Biomax 5 (Lactobacillus plantarum PA-28 and K-270), 1 x 10(5) cfu/g (B5), 5) Silo Guard II (sodium metabisulfite and amylase), 0.05{\%} of fresh forage weight (SG), 6) a buffered propionic acid-based additive, 0.1{\%} (Ki-112), 7), sodium benzoate, 0.1{\%} of fresh weight (SB), or 8) potassium sorbate:EDTA (1:1), 0.1{\%} of fresh weight (PSE). Silage treated with LLB4 had the highest concentration of acetic acid compared with other treatments, and yeasts were undetectable in LLB4 ({\textless}log2 cfu/g). Silages treated with SB and PSE had the highest concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates, the greatest recoveries of DM, and the lowest concentrations of ethanol. Silages treated with B5, SG, and Ki-112 had no effects on fermentation, DM recovery, or aerobic stability. The aerobic stabilities of silages treated with LLB4, SB, and PSE were greatest among all treatments. In yr 2, treatments were: 1) U, 2) LLB4, 3) PLB, 4) PLB at 4 x 10(5) cfu/g (PLB4), and 5) B5. Silages treated with L. buchneri had greater concentrations of acetic acid but lower concentrations of ethanol than did U- and B5-treated silages. Yeasts were undetected in all silages except in silage treated with B5, which had the poorest aerobic stability of all treatments. Treatments had no effect on DM recovery. Silages treated with PLB, PLB4, and LLB4 remained stable for {\textgreater}210 h.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Marginal posterior genotype probabilities need to be computed for genetic analyses such as geneticcounseling in humans and selective breeding in animal and plant species. METHODS: In this paper, we describe a peeling based, deterministic, exact algorithm to compute efficiently genotype probabilities for every member of a pedigree with loops without recourse to junction-tree methods from graph theory. The efficiency in computing the likelihood by peeling comes from storing intermediate results in multidimensional tables called cutsets. Computing marginal genotype probabilities for individual i requires recomputing the likelihood for each of the possible genotypes of individual i. This can be done efficiently by storing intermediate results in two types of cutsets called anterior and posterior cutsets and reusing these intermediate results to compute the likelihood. EXAMPLES: A small example is used to illustrate the theoretical concepts discussed in this paper, and marginal genotype probabilities are computed at a monogenic disease locus for every member in a real cattle pedigree.},

abstract = {To find out whether alkali-treated proteins posses nephrotoxic properties, feeding studies were conducted with drastically treated soybean protein and casein, and also with lysinoalanine (LAL), the amino acid known to be formed in protein subjected to high pH at elevated temperature. The feeding of synthesized LAL to rats at dietary levels of 100 ppm and above induced typical renal changes, called nephrocytomegalia. No such changes or any other indications of toxicity were observed, however, upon feeding much higher levels of LAL (up to 6,000 ppm) when provided as the protein-bound compound in alkali-treated casein or soybean protein. When set free by complete acid hydrolysis, LAL induced considerable renal activity, comparable to that of the synthetic compound. These results indicate that alkali treatment of proteins does not induce nephrotoxic properties provided that the compound remains protein-bound. Some nephrotoxic activity was observed, however, with peptide-boound LAL in break-down products (molecular weight less than 5,000) of alkali-treated casein, but considerably less than that of the free compound. LAL-analyses in blood, urine, and feces of rats fed free or protein-bound LAL indicated a positive correlation between intestinal absorption and nephrotoxic potential. No renal changes were encountered upon feeding diets with 1,000 ppm synthetic LAL to mice, hamsters, rabbits, quail, dogs or monkeys, which suggest a species specificity of LAL-induced renal changes in rats.},

abstract = {Neutrophil function is reduced in periparturient dairy cows. Possible factors that reduce neutrophil function include endocrine changes associated with parturition and metabolic stresses associated with lactogenesis. In this study, mastectomized and intact cows were studied to specifically examine the effects of lactogenesis on neutrophil function in periparturient cows. Expression of adhesion molecules on neutrophils (L-selectin, mediating capture and rolling adhesion, and beta 2-integrin, mediating tight adhesion vital to egress) and neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity (an index of bactericidal activity) were assessed in mastectomized and intact cows. Expression of L-selectin decreased at parturition followed by rapid recovery to prepartum values in both intact and mastectomized cows. Expression of beta 2-integrins increased in intact cows at parturition but not in mastectomized cows. Expression of beta 2-integrins was greater in intact cows than in mastectomized cows throughout the study. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity decreased from baseline prepartum values as parturition approached in both intact and mastectomized cows, which suggests the endocrine changes associated with the act of parturition are predominant factors causing loss of neutrophil function. Myeloperoxidase activity recovered to prepartum values within a week of parturition in mastectomized cows; however, myeloperoxidase activity remained depressed in neutrophils obtained from intact cows throughout the first 20 d of lactation. The presence of the mammary gland and its attendant metabolic stresses slowed recovery of neutrophil function, which suggests that the metabolic stress of lactation exacerbated periparturient immunosuppression.},

abstract = {Endotoxins are part of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. They are potent immune stimulators and can lead to death if present in high concentrations. Feed additives, which bind endotoxins in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, could help to prevent their negative impact. The objective of our study was to determine the potential of a bentonite (Bentonite 1), a sodium bentonite (Bentonite 2), a chemically treated smectite (Organoclay 1) and a modified attapulgite (Organoclay 2) to bind endotoxins in vitro. Polymyxin B served as positive control. The kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte lysate test was adapted to measure endotoxin activity. Firstly, a single sorption experiment (10 endotoxin units/mL (EU/mL)) was performed. Polymyxin B and organoclays showed 100{\%} binding efficiency. Secondly, the adsorption efficiency of sorbents in aqueous solution with increasing endotoxin concentrations (2,450 - 51,700 EU/mL) was investigated. Organoclay 1 (0.1{\%}) showed a good binding efficiency in aqueous solution (average 81{\%}), whereas Bentonite 1 (0.1{\%}) obtained a lower binding efficiency (21-54{\%}). The following absorbent capacities were calculated in highest endotoxin concentration: 5.59 mg/g (Organoclay 1) {\textgreater} 3.97 mg/g (Polymyxin B) {\textgreater} 2.58mg/g (Organoclay 2) {\textgreater} 1.55 mg/g (Bentonite 1) {\textgreater} 1.23 mg/g (Bentonite 2). Thirdly, a sorption experiment in artificial intestinal fluid was conducted. Especially for organoclays, which are known to be unspecific adsorbents, the endotoxin binding capacity was significantly reduced. In contrast, Bentonite 1 showed comparable results in artificial intestinal fluid and aqueous solution. Based on the results of this in vitro study, the effect of promising clay minerals will be investigated in in vivo trials.},

abstract = {An intriguing characteristic of imprinted genes is that they often cluster in large chromosomal domains, raising the possibility that gene-specific and domain-specific mechanisms regulate imprinting. Several common features emerged from comparative analysis of four imprinted domains in mice and humans: (a) Certain genes appear to be imprinted by secondary events, possibly indicating a lack of gene-specific imprinting marks; (b) some genes appear to resist silencing, predicting the presence of cis-elements that oppose domain-specific imprinting control; (c) the nature of the imprinting mark remains incompletely understood. In addition, common silencing mechanisms are employed by the various imprinting domains, including silencer elements that nucleate and propagate a silent chromatin state, insulator elements that prevent promoter-enhancer interactions when hypomethylated on one parental allele, and antisense RNAs that function in silencing the overlapping sense gene and more distantly located genes. These commonalities are reminiscent of the behavior of genes subjected to, and the mechanisms employed in, dosage compensation.},

abstract = {Evidence is increasing of positive effects of feeding fats during transition on fertility and the adaptation to lactation. This study used meta-analytic methods to explore the effects of including fats in the transition diet on the risk of pregnancy to service (proportion pregnant) and calving to pregnancy interval. Meta-analysis was used to integrate smaller studies and increase the statistical power over that of any single study and explore new hypotheses. We explored the effect of fats and diet composition on fertility using meta-regression methods. Relatively few highly controlled studies are available providing detailed descriptions of the diets used that examined interactions between fat nutrition and reproductive outcomes. Only 17 studies containing 26 comparisons were suitable for inclusion in statistical evaluations. Reproductive variables evaluated were risk of pregnancy (proportion pregnant), primarily to first service, and calving to pregnancy interval. Production variables examined were milk yield, milk composition, and body weight. The sources of heterogeneity in these studies were also explored. A 27{\%} overall increase in pregnancy to service was observed (relative risk=1.27; 95{\%} confidence interval Knapp Hartung 1.09 to 1.45), and results were relatively consistent (I2=19.9{\%}). A strong indication of a reduction in calving to pregnancy interval was also identified, which was consistent across studies (I2=0.0{\%}), supporting a conclusion that, overall, the inclusion of fats does improve fertility. Further exploration of the factors contributing to proportion pregnant using bivariate meta-regression identified variables that reflected changes in diet composition or animal response resulting from inclusion of the fat interventions in the experimental diets fed. Increased fermentable neutral detergent fiber and soluble fiber intakes increased the proportion pregnant, whereas increased milk yield of the treatment group decreased this measure. Unexpectedly, the estimated energy costs of urea production also had a positive association with proportion pregnant. The limited number of suitable studies for the analysis highlights the need for more work to improve understanding of the critical nutritional factors affecting fertility. These factors include specific fatty acids in dietary interventions that contribute to increasing fertility of cows in dairy production systems.},

abstract = {Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of a low dietary cation-anion balance (DCAB) in preventing milk fever and udder edema in dry cows consuming a high-Ca diet and to evaluate the effect of this diet on calves delivered by these cows. Seventy primiparous or multiparous cows and 50 pregnant heifers were offered alfalfa hay-based diets beginning 4 wk before their projected calving date. Diets contained 1.6{\%} Ca and a DCAB of -3 or +9 mEq/100 g of diet DM. Blood and urine samples were collected weekly from 3 wk prepartum until 3 wk postpartum. Blood samples were collected from calves at parturition and weekly thereafter for 3 wk. Feeding a low vs high DCAB in a high-Ca diet for 3 wk prepartum did not reduce the incidence of milk fever; this lack of response may have been attributable to the relatively low DCAB of each diet and the small difference in DCAB between the two diets. Udder edema seemed to regress more rapidly postpartum for cows that had consumed the low DCAB during the dry period. Test diets fed to prepartum cows did not affect systemic acid-base status or plasma mineral content of their calves, although plasma Ca was somewhat lower for calves from cows consuming a low DCAB and was higher for calves from primigravid cows. Correlations of plasma mineral concentration of the cows with those of their calves were highest for plasma Ca (r = .75; P less than .001). We conclude that the prophylactic effects on the occurrence of milk fever of feeding a low DCAB during the dry period may be absent when diets contain greater than 1.6{\%} Ca and DCAB is greater than or equal to -3. The cation-anion balance of the diet consumed by dry cows did not affect the acid-based status or plasma mineral content of their calves.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine risk factors for udder edema (case-control study) and to evaluate the association of udder edema in primiparous Holstein cows with their lactation performance (cohort study). Values for the first 10 test day for milk yield, fat, protein, and somatic cell counts (SCC) linear score as well as mature equivalent (ME) 305 days milk yield, fat, protein, SCC linear score, and incidences of periparturient diseases from a computerized farm recording system were compared between primiparous cows with and without udder edema. Data consisted of 118 dairy heifers with udder edema, induced for parturition, and treated with diuretics and 889 control heifers that received no treatment. Primiparous cows giving birth to male calves, were 1.72 (1.01, 3.24; 95{\%} CI) times more likely to develop udder edema than cows giving birth to female calves. Primiparous cows calving in winter season were 3.68 (1.09, 12.5; 95{\%} CI) times more likely to develop udder edema than cows calving in summer. For each extra 10cm in height the odds of udder edemas was 1.23 (1.03, 1.47; 95{\%} CI). The first test day DHIA milk yield was lower in cows that developed udder edema (3.6kg/day) than in normal cows. However, the subsequent test days and ME measurements were not statistically different between groups. Cows with udder edema were 1.62 (1.18, 2.14; 95{\%} CI) times more likely to develop udder edema in the second lactation than control animals. It is concluded that the gender of the offspring, calving season and height at parturition were significant risk factors for udder edema. Only milk yield on the first DHIA test day was lower in cows with udder edema than in cows without udder edema.},

abstract = {A field study was conducted to evaluate the effects of oral drenching with additional energy or energy plus calcium on blood parameters and performance of fresh cows. Treatments were 9.5 L water (control), 9.5 L water plus 300 mL (310 g) propylene glycol (PG), or 9.5 L water plus 0.68 kg calcium propionate (CP). Cows received the assigned drench within 4 h of calving and again 24 h post-calving. Animals were bled prior to each drench and on d 4 and 10 of lactation. Animals were fed and managed by parity (primiparous vs multiparous) in a commercial setting. Health events were recorded during calving and for the first 15 d in milk (DIM). Milk records were evaluated from monthly test weights the first 4 mo in lactation. The addition of PG or CP did not affect either plasma calcium or glucose (P{\textgreater}0.05). Plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels were lower in animals receiving the PG drench as compared with animals receiving either the control or CP treatment (P{\textless}0.05). Plasma {\ss}- hydroxybutyrate was lowest at calving but was not affected by treatment. Health disorders (retained placenta, ketosis, hypocalcemia, displaced aboma- sum, metritis) were low across all treatment groups. Cattle receiving either PG or CP at calving had a significantly lower incidence of metritis compared with control animals (P{\textless}0.05). Aver- aged across all trial periods, animals receiving PG had 3.1 kg/d greater milk production than those receiving the control drench (P{\textless}0.05).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selenium (Se) is important for the postnatal development of the calf. In the first weeks of life, milk is the only source of Se for the calf and insufficient level of Se in the milk may lead to Se deficiency. Maternal Se supplementation is used to prevent this.We investigated the effect of dietary Se-enriched yeast (SY) or sodium selenite (SS) supplements on selected blood parameters and on Se concentrations in the blood, colostrum, and milk of Se-deficient Charolais cows. METHODS: Cows in late pregnancy received a mineral premix with Se (SS or SY, 50 mg Se per kg premix) or without Se (control--C). Supplementation was initiated 6 weeks before expected calving. Blood and colostrum samples were taken from the cows that had just calved (Colostral period). Additional samples were taken around 2 weeks (milk) and 5 weeks (milk and blood) after calving corresponding to Se supplementation for 6 and 12 weeks, respectively (Lactation period) for Se, biochemical and haematological analyses. RESULTS: Colostral period. Se concentrations in whole blood and colostrum on day 1 post partum and in colostrum on day 3 post partum were 93.0, 72.9, and 47.5 microg/L in the SY group; 68.0, 56.0 and 18.8 microg/L in the SS group; and 35.1, 27.3 and 10.5 microg/L in the C group, respectively. Differences among all the groups were significant (P {\textless} 0.01) at each sampling, just as the colostrum Se content decreases were from day 1 to day 3 in each group. The relatively smallest decrease in colostrum Se concentration was found in the SY group (P {\textless} 0.01).Lactation period. The mean Se concentrations in milk in weeks 6 and 12 of supplementation were 20.4 and 19.6 microg/L in the SY group, 8.3 and 11.9 microgg/L in the SS group, and 6.9 and 6.6 microgg/L in the C group, respectively. The values only differed significantly in the SS group (P {\textless} 0.05). The Se concentrations in the blood were similar to those of cows examined on the day of calving. The levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity were 364.70, 283.82 and 187.46 microgkat/L in the SY, SS, and C groups, respectively. This was the only significantly variable biochemical and haematological parameter. CONCLUSION: Se-enriched yeast was much more effective than sodium selenite in increasing the concentration of Se in the blood, colostrum and milk, as well as the GSH-Px activity.},

Reducing concentration of dietary crude protein to 13.5{\%} at 1 mo postpartum tended to decrease intake of dry matter during the 2nd and 3rd mo of lactation. Milk production of multiparous, but not primiparous cows, was decreased. Dry matter intake and milk production did not decrease following a drop in concentration of dietary protein at 2 mo postpartum. Returns over feed costs were reduced by feeding the diet with 17{\%} crude protein to primiparous cows longer than 1 mo or to multiparous cows longer than 2 mo postpartum. Milk composition, body weight change, and reproductive performance were not affected by treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two key findings from genomic selection experiments are 1) the reference population used must be very large to subsequently predict accurate genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV), and 2) prediction equations derived in one breed do not predict accurate GEBV when applied to other breeds. Both findings are a problem for breeds where the number of individuals in the reference population is limited. A multi-breed reference population is a potential solution, and here we investigate the accuracies of GEBV in Holstein dairy cattle and Jersey dairy cattle when the reference population is single breed or multi-breed. The accuracies were obtained both as a function of elements of the inverse coefficient matrix and from the realised accuracies of GEBV.

METHODS: Best linear unbiased prediction with a multi-breed genomic relationship matrix (GBLUP) and two Bayesian methods (BAYESA and BAYES{\_}SSVS) which estimate individual SNP effects were used to predict GEBV for 400 and 77 young Holstein and Jersey bulls respectively, from a reference population of 781 and 287 Holstein and Jersey bulls, respectively. Genotypes of 39,048 SNP markers were used. Phenotypes in the reference population were de-regressed breeding values for production traits. For the GBLUP method, expected accuracies calculated from the diagonal of the inverse of coefficient matrix were compared to realised accuracies.

RESULTS: When GBLUP was used, expected accuracies from a function of elements of the inverse coefficient matrix agreed reasonably well with realised accuracies calculated from the correlation between GEBV and EBV in single breed populations, but not in multi-breed populations. When the Bayesian methods were used, realised accuracies of GEBV were up to 13{\%} higher when the multi-breed reference population was used than when a pure breed reference was used. However no consistent increase in accuracy across traits was obtained.

CONCLUSION: Predicting genomic breeding values using a genomic relationship matrix is an attractive approach to implement genomic selection as expected accuracies of GEBV can be readily derived. However in multi-breed populations, Bayesian approaches give higher accuracies for some traits. Finally, multi-breed reference populations will be a valuable resource to fine map QTL.},

Eight lactating dairy cows were used in a replicated 4×4 Latin square design with 29-d periods (21d of dietary adaptation and 8d of measurements) and a 2×2 factorial arrangement of dietary treatments. Four cows in 1 Latin square were ruminally cannulated to allow ruminal and omasal sampling. The treatment factors were (1) source of supplemental protein (CM vs. W-DDGS) and (2) dietary CP content (15 vs. 17{\%}; DM basis). Diets contained 50{\%} forage and 50{\%} concentrate, and were fed twice daily at 0900 and 1600 h as total mixed rations for ad libitum intake. Dry matter intake and milk yield were unaffected by dietary treatments; however, milk yield in cows that were fed CM was numerically greater (+1.1kg/d) when compared with cows fed W-DDGS. Feeding CM increased milk lactose content compared with feeding W-DDGS. Milk urea nitrogen and ruminal NH3-N concentrations were greater in cows fed the high-CP compared with those fed the low-CP diet. The rumen-degradable protein supply was greater in cows fed the high-CP when compared with those fed the low-CP diet when diets contained CM, whereas rumen-degradable protein supply was lower in cows fed the high-CP when compared with those fed the low-CP diet when diets contained W-DDGS. Total N flow at the omasal canal was not affected by diet; however, omasal flow of NH3-N was greater in cows fed CM when compared with those fed W-DDGS. The rumen-undegradable protein supply was greater in cows fed the low-CP when compared with those fed the high-CP diet when diets contained CM, whereas rumen-undegradable protein supply was lower in cows fed the low-CP when compared with those fed the high-CP diet when diets contained W-DDGS. Omasal flow of fluid-associated bacteria was greater and that of particle-associated bacteria tended to be greater in cows fed CM when compared with those fed W-DDGS; however, omasal flow of total microbial nonammonia N was unaffected by dietary treatment. Omasal flows of threonine and tryptophan were greater, whereas that of histidine and lysine tended to be greater in cows fed CM when compared with those fed W-DDGS. Our results show that when dairy diets are formulated to contain 15 or 17{\%} CP, CM or W-DDGS can be used as the major source of protein and achieve similar levels of milk production.},

abstract = {Due to renewed interest in feeding acidified milk replacer (MR) for ad libitum consumption within North America, two 112-d trials were conducted using Holstein calves obtained from one dairy farm at 2 to 3 d of age. In trial 1, a 27{\%} crude protein (whey protein), 17{\%} fat MR powder was reconstituted with water to 14{\%} solids and fed at 0.66 kg of dry matter (DM) per day for 42 d (CON) or acidified to pH 4.2 using citric acid and offered 24 h/d for d 0 to 35, then switched to 0.66 kg of DM without acid per d for 7 d (A4). In trial 2, the same MR was fed as CON, ad libitum pH 5.2 MR offered from 0600 to 0800 h and 1600 to 1800 h for d 0 to 21 (R5), ad libitum pH 5.2 MR offered 24 h/d for d 0 to 35 (A5), and ad libitum pH 4.2 MR offered 24 h/d for d 0 to 35 (A4). After the ad libitum period, calves on R5, A5, and A4 were switched to CON until d 42. Growth measures were made until d 112 in each trial. Data from each trial were analyzed as a completely randomized design with repeated measurements over time using an autoregressive type 1 covariance structure when appropriate. In each trial, calves fed CON had lower average daily gain (ADG) from 0 to 42 d and greater ADG from 42 to 56 d than calves fed the other treatments. In both trials, ADG from 0 to 56 d and 56 to 112 d were not greater for A4 or A5 versus CON. From 56 to 112 d in trial 2, ADG was greater for R5 versus A5. Some calves completely rejected the MR at pH 4.2. Calves consumed more of the MR at pH 5.2 than 4.2. Calves fed A4 in trial 1 and treatments A5 and A4 in trial 2 consumed {\textgreater}95{\%} of their MR between 0600 to 0800 h and 1600 to 1800 h. Time spent standing did not differ by treatment in trial 1 and increased from 312 to 332 min/d from d 6 to 56. Under the conditions of these trials, results to 112 d showed no advantage to feeding calves MR acidified to pH 4.2 or 5.2 ad libitum from 0 to 35 d with gradually weaning by 42 d compared with calves fed the control MR fed at 0.66 kg of DM/d. Additionally, when calves were fed MR ad libitum, they consumed {\textgreater}95{\%} of the MR between 0600 to 0800 h and 1600 to 1800 h and standing behavior was not greatly affected.},

abstract = {Feeding nitrate to dairy cows may lower ruminal methane production by competing for reducing equivalents with methanogenesis. Twenty lactating Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (33.2±6.0 kg of milk/d; 104±58 d in milk at the start of the experiment) were fed a total mixed ration (corn silage-based; forage to concentrate ratio 66:34), containing either a dietary urea or a dietary nitrate source [21 g of nitrate/kg of dry matter (DM)] during 4 successive 24-d periods, to assess the methane-mitigating potential of dietary nitrate and its persistency. The study was conducted as paired comparisons in a randomized design with repeated measurements. Cows were blocked by parity, lactation stage, and milk production at the start of the experiment. A 4-wk adaptation period allowed the rumen microbes to adapt to dietary urea and nitrate. Diets were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous. Methane production, energy balance, and diet digestibility were measured in open-circuit indirect calorimetry chambers. Cows were limit-fed during measurements. Nitrate persistently decreased methane production by 16{\%}, whether expressed in grams per day, grams per kilogram of dry matter intake (DMI), or as percentage of gross energy intake, which was sustained for the full experimental period (mean 368 vs. 310±12.5 g/d; 19.4 vs. 16.2±0.47 g/kg of DMI; 5.9 vs.4.9±0.15{\%} of gross energy intake for urea vs. nitrate, respectively). This decrease was smaller than the stoichiometrical methane mitigation potential of nitrate (full potential=28{\%} methane reduction). The decreased energy loss from methane resulted in an improved conversion of dietary energy intake into metabolizable energy (57.3 vs. 58.6±0.70{\%}, urea vs. nitrate, respectively). Despite this, milk energy output or energy retention was not affected by dietary nitrate. Nitrate did not affect milk yield or apparent digestibility of crude fat, neutral detergent fiber, and starch. Milk protein content (3.21 vs. 3.05±0.058{\%}, urea vs. nitrate respectively) but not protein yield was lower for dietary nitrate. Hydrogen production between morning and afternoon milking was measured during the last experimental period. Cows fed nitrate emitted more hydrogen. Cows fed nitrate displayed higher blood methemoglobin levels (0.5 vs. 4.0±1.07{\%} of hemoglobin, urea vs. nitrate respectively) and lower hemoglobin levels (7.1 vs. 6.3±0.11 mmol/L, urea vs. nitrate respectively).

abstract = {Standard genetic analyses assume that reciprocal heterozygotes are, on average, phenotypically identical. If a locus is subject to genomic imprinting, however, this assumption does not hold. We incorporate imprinting into the standard quantitative-genetic model for two alleles at a single locus, deriving expressions for the additive and dominance components of genetic variance, as well as measures of resemblance among relatives. We show that, in contrast to the case with Mendelian expression, the additive and dominance deviations are correlated. In principle, this correlation allows imprinting to be detected solely on the basis of different measures of familial resemblances, but in practice, the standard error of the estimate is likely to be too large for a test to have much statistical power. The effects of genomic imprinting will need to be incorporated into quantitative-genetic models of many traits, for example, those concerned with mammalian birthweight.},

abstract = {The objective of this investigation was to study the effects of feeding backgrounding and finishing diets on selected acute phase proteins in the plasma of feedlot steers. Two groups of 12 steers each, at the backgrounding and finishing stages, were offered either a backgrounding (45{\%} barley grain-based concentrate and 55{\%} barley silage on a DM basis) or a finishing (91{\%} barley grain-based concentrate and 9{\%} barley silage) diet for 12 and 15 wk, respectively. Steers at the backgrounding and finishing stages had initial BW of approximately 250 and 380 kg, respectively, at the beginning of the experiment. Blood samples were obtained from a jugular vein at 3-wk intervals during the experimental period beginning at wk 3 or 0 for the backgrounding and finishing periods, respectively. Plasma samples were analyzed for serum amyloid A (SAA), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), haptoglobin, and alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein. Steers fed the finishing diet showed peak plasma SAA, LBP, and haptoglobin within 3 wk from the initiation of the diet (20, 23, and 1,940 microg/mL for SAA, LBP, and haptoglobin, respectively). Although plasma alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein reached a peak concentration (449 microg/mL) at the beginning of the finishing phase, no diet effect was obtained for this variable. Steers fed the backgrounding diet showed less variation in the concentrations of plasma acute phase proteins measured; plasma haptoglobin reached a peak concentration (1,720 microg/mL) 9 wk after the beginning of this diet. In conclusion, feeding feedlot steers the backgrounding or finishing diet was associated with increased peak concentrations of acute phase proteins in the plasma. More research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms behind the inflammatory responses observed in feedlot steers and their implications for health issues and the production efficiency of feedlot operations.},

abstract = {Our objectives were to determine the effects of rapid growth rate during the preweaning period and prepubertal protein supplementation on long-term growth pattern and milk production during the first lactation. Forty-six Israeli Holstein heifer calves were fed either milk replacer (MR) or whole milk (WM) from 4 to 60 d age. Calves had free access to WM or MR for 30 min twice daily and free-choice water and starter mix for the entire day. From weaning until 150 d of age, all heifers were fed the same ration. At 150 d of age the heifers were divided into 2 subgroups, with one subgroup supplemented with an additional 2{\%} protein until 320 d of age. Thereafter, all heifers were housed and fed together until calving. Another cluster of 20 heifers was raised on MR and WM treatments and 3 animals from each nursery treatment were slaughtered at 60 d and 10 mo age to determine effects of nursery treatment on organ and adipose tissue mass. Prior to weaning, the MR heifers consumed 0.12 kg/d more DM than the WM heifers, but metabolizable energy intake was not different. Body weight at weaning and average daily gain during the preweaning period were 3.1 kg and 0.074 kg/d higher, respectively, in the WM treatment than in the MR treatment, with no differences in other measurements. Nursery feeding treatment and added protein had no effect on growth rate in the prepubertal period, but the postweaning difference in BW between the WM and MR heifers remained throughout the entire rearing period. The age at first insemination was 23 d earlier and age at pregnancy and first calving was numerically lower for the WM heifers than for the MR heifers. Adipose tissue weights at weaning were doubled in the WM calves. First-lactation milk production and 4{\%} fat-corrected milk were 10.3 and 7.1{\%} higher, respectively, for WM heifers than for MR heifers, whereas prepubertal added protein tended to increase milk yield. In conclusion, preweaning WM at high feeding rates appears to have long-term effects that are beneficial to future milk production. The positive long-term effects of feeding WM on first-lactation milk production were independent of their effects on skeletal growth. Enhanced milk production observed with WM treatment may be related to the milk supply, paracrine or endocrine effects of fat tissues on mammary parenchyma, or a combination of both factors.},

These were compared in animals with (n=14) and without (n=40) a retained placenta and then according to 2 prepartum diets (corn silage/concentrate, n=44; grass silage/concentrate, n=10) in cows with and without retained placentas. Cows with retained placentas had a 4-day shorter gestation period and gave birth to 5 kg-lighter calves than cows without retained placentas. Furthermore, their plasma PGFM -PgF2$\alpha$ main metabolite- (3325 vs 5675 pg/ml; P{\textless}0.01) and glucose (79.2 vs 95.2 mg/100ml; P{\textless}0.05) levels were lower and their protein concentration was higher (85.7 vs 76.5 g/l; P{\textless}0.05) than those of cows without retained placentas. Retained placenta incidence in cows fed grass-silage was higher than in cows fed corn-silage (60{\%} vs 18.2{\%}; P{\textless}0.05). Cows with retained placentas and fed corn silage had shorter gestation lengths, gave birth to lighter calves, and had less circulating glucose at calving (77.6 vs 96.5 mg/100ml; P{\textless}0.05) than cows without retained placentas and fed the same forage. Cows with retained placentas and fed grass silage had less PGFM (2172 vs 4530 pg/ml; P{\textless}0.05) than cows without retained placentas and fed the same forage. Calving number, sex ratio and preceeding milk yield were not different between the two groups of cows whatever their prepartum diet. In the dairy cow, retained placenta could be due to a PgF2$\alpha$ or an energy deficiency at calving. Roles of the dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids toward the Pg synthesis and of the energy supply before calving in relation to retained placenta are discussed here. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {When cows with a “higher” body condition score (BCS) are oversupplied with energy during the dry period, postpartum energy balance is normally reduced, which can have a detrimental effect on immune competence and increase the infectious disease risk. However, within grassland-based systems higher yielding cows frequently have a low BCS at drying off. The effects on performance, health, and metabolic and immune functions of providing additional energy to cows with low BCS during the dry period is less certain. To address this uncertainty, 53 multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows (mean BCS of 2.5; 1–5 scale) were allocated to 1 of 2 treatments at dry-off: silage only or silage plus concentrates. Cows on the silage-only treatment were offered ad libitum access to medium-quality grass silage. Cows on the silage-plus-concentrate treatment were offered ad libitum access to a mixed ration comprising the same grass silage plus concentrates [in a 75:25 dry matter (DM) ratio], which provided a mean concentrate DM intake of 3.0kg/cow per day. Postpartum, cows were offered a common mixed ration comprising grass silage and concentrates (in a 40:60 DM ratio) for a 70-d period. Offering concentrates during the dry period increased DM intake, tended to increase energy balance, and increased body weight (BW) and BCS gain prepartum. Offering concentrates during the dry period increased BW and BCS loss postpartum and tended to increase milk fat percentage and serum nonesterified fatty acid concentration, but it did not affect postpartum DM intake, energy balance, and milk yield. Although the percentage of phagocytosis-positive neutrophils did not differ, neutrophils from cows on the silage-plus-concentrate treatment had higher phagocytic fluorescence intensity at 1 and 2 wk postpartum and higher phagocytic index at 1 wk postpartum. Serum haptoglobin concentrations and IFN-$\gamma$ production by pokeweed mitogen stimulated whole blood culture were unaffected by treatment, although haptoglobin concentrations increased and IFN-$\gamma$ production decreased peripartum. Offering concentrates during the dry period increased the incidence of lameness postpartum, although other health and fertility parameters were unaffected. In conclusion, supplementing low BCS cows with concentrates during the dry period had no effect on performance and fertility and resulted in a higher neutrophil phagocytic index at 1 wk postpartum and an increased incidence of lameness compared with offering cows a grass silage–only diet prepartum.},

abstract = {This fact sheet has been developed to support the implementation of the Natural Resources Conservation Service Feed Management 592 Practice Standard. The Feed Management 592 Practice Standard was adopted by NRCS in 2003 as another tool to assist with addressing resource concerns on livestock and poultry operations. Feed management can assist with reducing the import of nutrients to the farm and reduce the excretion of nutrients in manure. The Natural Resources Conservation Service has adopted a practice standard called Feed Management (592) and is defined as “managing the quantity of available nutrients fed to livestock and poultry for their intended purpose”. The national version of the practice standard can be found in a companion fact sheet entitled “An Introduction to Natural Resources Feed Management Practice Standard 592”. Please check in your own state for a state-specific version of the standard. Nitrogen (N) is the building block of proteins in feeds and forages. Protein is typically the most expensive component of the purchased feeds used in dairy rations. Nitrogen is also receiving more attention as a component of nutrient management plans on dairy farms and potential ammonia emissions. Understanding how N is used in dairy cattle is important in improving both profitability and decreasing excretion from the cow into the environment. It is important to remember that dairy cows do not have a protein requirement. They really need amino acids available in the small intestine to support tissue growth and milk production. Basically, N utilization in dairy cattle is composed of two components. The first is providing an adequate supply of N and carbohydrates in the rumen to support the growth of rumen microorganisms and the production of microbial crude protein (MCP). The second part of the system is the utilization of amino acids in the small intestine to provide for the needs of the cow.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of non-protected and rumen-protected gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) supplementation on dry matter intake (DMI), energy balance, milk performance, and serum metabolites in transition cows. Forty cows were blocked based on previous milk production, parity, estimated calving date and body weight and were randomly assigned to one of four treatments and received either no GABA (control) or were supplemented with non-protected GABA (0.6. g/day) or rumen-protected GABA (0.6 and 1.2. g/day), respectively. The experiment lasted from week 2 before calving to week 4 after calving. Milk yield and milk composition were recorded weekly. Serum concentrations of GABA, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin, leptin and biochemical and antioxidative metabolites were analyzed weekly. In week 3 and 4 after calving, DMI was higher (P{\textless}0.05) in the cows fed 1.2. g/day rumen-protected GABA, compared with that of the control. In week 4 after calving, milk protein yield was higher in the cows fed 1.2. g/day rumen-protected GABA than that of the control cows. No differences were observed in the serum concentrations of GABA, neuropeptide Y and leptin among all the treatments, while non-esterified fatty acids and cholecystokinin concentrations decreased (P{\textless}0.01) in cows fed rumen-protected GABA on day 15 and 22 after calving, respectively. Serum total antioxidative capacity and concentrations of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were higher (P{\textless}0.05) at several sampling points in cows fed rumen-protected GABA. In conclusion, supplementation of rumen-protected GABA at 1.2. g/day increased feed intake, improved milk protein yield, and decreased non-esterified fatty acids suggesting supplementation may be beneficial to postpartum dairy cows. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This project aimed to determine if a dual-purpose bacterial inoculant could mitigate potential adverse effects of increasing levels of rust infestation on the quality, aerobic stability, and safety of corn silage. Corn plants with no rust infestation (NR), or medium (all leaves on the lower half of the plant affected, MR), or high (all leaves affected, HR) levels of southern rust infestation were harvested at random locations on a field, chopped, and ensiled without (control, CON) or with a dual-purpose inoculant applied at a rate that supplied 1×10(5)cfu/g of Pediococcus pentosaceus 12455 and 4×10(5)cfu/g of Lactobacillus buchneri 40788. Each treatment was prepared in quadruplicate in 20-L mini silos and ensiled for 97 d. As the level of rust infestation increased, the concentrations of dry matter (DM) and neutral detergent fiber increased, whereas DM digestibility decreased by up to 16{\%}. Control HR silages also had lower 24-h neutral detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD; 36.2{\%} of DM) than CON MR (39.8{\%}) or NR silages (38.1{\%}). Inoculation increased the NDFD of NR (43.4{\%}) and MR silages (45.7{\%}) but not HR silages (33.0{\%}). Concentrations of lactate and volatile fatty acids decreased with increasing rust infestation in CON silages, but this trend was absent in inoculated silages. In HR silages, inoculation increased aerobic stability by 75{\%} (77.3 vs. 44h), and prevented production of aflatoxin (5.2 vs. 0mg/kg). The concentration of aflatoxin in uninoculated HR silages exceeded action levels stipulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. In conclusion, increasing rust infestation was associated with reductions in the nutritive value and fermentation of corn silage. Inoculation reduced adverse effects of rust infestation on the fermentation, increased 24-h NDFD of NR and MR silages, and decreased aerobic spoilage and aflatoxin production in HR silages.},

imprinted genes and statistical properties of
methods to detect imprinted QTL are
studied. Different models to detect imprinted QTL
and to distinguish between imprinted and Mendelian

and imprinted QTL were simulated in an F2 design and
analyzed under Mendelian and imprinting models. Mode
of expression was evaluated against the H0 of a
Mendelian QTL as well as the H0 of an imprinted
QTL. It was shown that imprinted QTL might remain
undetected when analyzing the genome with Mendelian
models only. Compared to testing against a Mendelian
QTL, using the H0 of an imprinted QTL gave a higher
proportion of correctly identified imprinted QTL,
but also gave a higher proportion of false inference
of imprinting for Mendelian QTL. When QTL were
segregating in the founder lines, spurious detection
of imprinting became more prominent under both
tests, especially for designs with a small number of
F1 sires. },

abstract = {Automated walk-over weighing systems can be used to monitor liveweights of cattle. Minimal literature exists to describe agreement between automated and static scales, and no known studies describe repeatability when used for daily measurements of dairy cows. This study establishes the repeatability of an automated walk-over cattle-weighing system, and agreement with static electronic scales, when used in a commercial dairy herd to weigh lactating cows. Forty-six lactating dairy cows from a seasonal calving, pasture-based dairy herd in southwest Victoria, Australia, were weighed once using a set of static scales and repeatedly using an automated walk-over weighing system at the exit of a rotary dairy. Substantial agreement was observed between the automated and static scales when assessed using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. Weights measured by the automated walkover scales were within 5{\%} of those measured by the static scales in 96{\%} of weighings. Bland and Altman's 95{\%} limits of agreement were -23.3 to 43.6 kg, a range of 66.9 kg. The 95{\%} repeatability coefficient for automated weighings was 46.3 kg. Removal of a single outlier from the data set increased Lin's concordance coefficient, narrowed Bland and Altman's 95{\%} limits of agreement to a range of 32.5 kg, and reduced the 95{\%} repeatability coefficient to 18.7 kg. Cow misbehavior during walk-over weighing accounted for many of the larger weight discrepancies. The automated walk-over weighing system showed substantial agreement with the static scales when assessed using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. This contrasted with limited agreement when assessed using Bland and Altman's method, largely due to poor repeatability. This suggests the automated weighing system is inadequate for detecting small liveweight differences in individual cows based on comparisons of single weights. Misbehaviors and other factors can result in the recording of spurious values on walk-over scales. Excluding outlier weights and comparing means of 7 consecutive daily weights may improve agreement sufficiently to allow meaningful assessment of small short-term changes in automated weights in individuals and groups of cows.},

abstract = {Genomic selection refers to the use of genomewide dense markers for breeding value estimation and subsequently for selection. The main challenge of genomic breeding value estimation is the estimation of many effects from a limited number of observations. Bayesian methods have been proposed to successfully cope with these challenges. As an alternative class of models, non- and semiparametric models were recently introduced. The present study investigated the ability of nonparametric additive regression models to predict genomic breeding values. The genotypes were modelled for each marker or pair of flanking markers (i.e. the predictors) separately. The nonparametric functions for the predictors were estimated simultaneously using additive model theory, applying a binomial kernel. The optimal degree of smoothing was determined by bootstrapping. A mutation-drift-balance simulation was carried out. The breeding values of the last generation (genotyped) was predicted using data from the next last generation (genotyped and phenotyped). The results show moderate to high accuracies of the predicted breeding values. A determination of predictor specific degree of smoothing increased the accuracy.},

abstract = {The objectives were to study the effects of feeding rolled flaxseed (FLX) to early-lactation dairy cows on milk yield, milk components, and milk fatty acid profiles as well as on measures of cow reproduction. Lactating Holstein cows, on 3 commercial dairies, were fed either an early-lactation ration (CON) or a ration that was similar in protein, energy, and fat content but that included FLX (0.85 kg of DM/cow per day). Within each dairy, cows were allocated alternately to breeding pens upon leaving the fresh pen (approximately 10 ± 5 d postpartum). Pens (n = 4 to 5 pens/dairy) were randomized to treatment (n = 2 to 3 pens/treatment per dairy). Pen (CON, n = 6; FLX, n = 7) was considered the experimental unit and data were analyzed as a split plot with pen as the whole-plot error term. Cows fed FLX had greater (P ≤ 0.06) proportions of cis-9, trans-11 C18:2, C18:3n-3, and C20:0 fatty acids in milk fat and a lesser (P = 0.03) proportion of C20:3n-6 fatty acid when compared with cows fed the CON diet. Treatment did not affect (P ≥ 0.24) milk yield, milk protein, protein yield, milk fat, or milk fat yield. No interactions (P ≥ 0.52) were found between treatment and season of the year or parity, or between treatment and days open, pregnancies per AI at first or second service, or pregnancy loss. In conclusion, feeding FLX at 0.85 kg/cow per day (DM basis) altered the fatty acid profile of milk, but milk yield, milk composition, and reproductive performance of dairy cows were not affected.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the effect of feeding a control diet (CON) or a moderate energy diet (overfed, OVE) during the dry period (∼45d) and a postpartum intramammary lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge on blood metabolic and inflammatory indices, milk production, and hepatic gene expression. A subset of cows (n=9/diet) in CON (1.34 Mcal/kg of dry matter) and OVE (1.62 Mcal/kg of dry matter) received an intramammary LPS challenge (200 $\mu$g; CON-LPS, OVE-LPS, respectively). Liver biopsies were harvested at -14 d from calving, and postpartum at 2.5h post-LPS on d 7, 14, and 30. Prepartum, the OVE group was in more positive energy balance (EB) and had greater body condition score compared with CON. In contrast, during wk 1 postpartum and before the LPS challenge, the OVE group was in greater negative EB than CON. Prepartal diet did not affect postpartal milk production or dry matter intake. At 2h postchallenge on d 7, we observed an increase in serum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and bilirubin and a decrease in hydroxybutyrate, regardless of diet. That was coupled with greater haptoglobin in OVE-LPS compared with CON-LPS. In addition, OVE-LPS cows versus CON nonchallenged, OVE nonchallenged, and CON-LPS had greater liver triacylglycerol (TAG) concentration 2.5h postchallenge on d 7. The concentration of TAG in liver of OVE-LPS remained elevated by 30d postpartum. The liver TAG concentration in OVE-LPS compared with CON-LPS cows was associated with greater serum concentration of NEFA and reactive oxygen metabolites on d 10 and 14 postpartum. Cows in OVE-LPS also had greater concentrations of ceruloplasmin, cholesterol, and vitamin E from d 10 through 21. Among 28 genes associated with fatty acid oxidation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and gluconeogenesis, only SAA3 (which encodes an acute phase protein) was greater in CON-LPS compared with OVE-LPS at 2.5h postchallenge. Expression of HP, which encodes another acute phase protein, was greater in OVE-LPS than in CON-LPS at 14 and 30 d postpartum. Several inflammation-related genes (TNF, IRAK1, NFKB1, ANGPTL4) showed markedly decreased expression between 7 and 14 d, after which expression remained unchanged. No differences were observed in several genes of the growth-hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis, except for SOCS2, expression of which decreased markedly between 7 and 14 d in OVE-LPS but not in CON-LPS. These data suggest that overfeeding a moderate-energy diet prepartum alters the response of the cow to an intramammary challenge after calving and may predispose it to sustained liver lipidosis.},

abstract = {The resistance of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to Rhynchosporium secalis (scald) has been investigated in two crosses between the susceptible cv. 'Ingrid' and two resistant Ethiopian landraces, 'Steudelli' and 'Jet'. Doubled haploids were inoculated in replicated tests using two isolates of R. secalis, '4004' and 'WRS1872'. Expression of resistance differed widely between replicated tests. AFLP, SSR and RFLP markers were used to develop chromosome maps. Results have been analysed using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and interval mapping. In PLSR the major covariance structures or 'latent variables' between X (markers) and Y (isolates, tests) are modelled as principal components and their optimal number determined by cross-validation. In 'Steudelli' two QTL were detected, one on each of chromosomes 3H and 7H, in 4 out of 5 tests, while in 'Jet' only one (different) allele at the 3H locus was found. The validated R(2) varied between 11.0{\%} and 64.9{\%} in the replicated tests with '4004'.With isolate 'WRS1872' the 7H locus and another 3H locus were detected. By interval mapping the QTL detected were less stable and generally gave lower R(2) values than PLSR. PLSR does not depend on maps, but interval mapping based on values predicted by PLSR had R(2) around 90{\%}. It is suggested that PLSR may be a useful tool in QTL analysis.},

abstract = {Two lactation trials were conducted comparing the feeding value of silages made from birdsfoot trefoil (BFT, Lotus corniculatus L.) that had been selected for low (BFTL), medium (BFTM), and high (BFTH) lev-els of condensed tannins (CT) to an alfalfa silage (AS) when fed as the principal forage in total mixed rations. Diets also included corn silage, high-moisture shelled corn, soybean meal, soy hulls, and supplemental fat. In trial 1, 32 lactating Holstein cows were blocked by days in milk, assigned to treatment sequences in 8 balanced 4 × 4 Latin squares, and fed 50{\%} dietary dry matter from AS or 1 of 3 BFT silages containing 0.6, 1.2, or 1.7{\%} CT. Diets averaged 17.5 to 19.5{\%} crude protein and 26{\%} neutral detergent fiber on a dry matter basis. Data were collected over the last 2 wk of each 4-wk pe-riod. Intakes were 1.3 to 2.8 kg of dry matter/d greater on BFT than on AS and cows gained 0.5 kg of body weight/d on BFT diets while losing 0.14 kg of body weight/d on the AS diet; this resulted in greater milk per dry matter intake (DMI) on AS. Linear effects indi-cated true protein yield and milk urea nitrogen declined with increasing CT concentration and quadratic effects indicated DMI, energy-corrected milk, and fat yield were increased at intermediate CT concentration. True protein yield and apparent N-efficiency were greater, and milk urea nitrogen lower, on all BFT diets than on AS. In trial 2, 50 lactating Holstein cows were fed a covariate AS diet for 2 wk and then blocked by parity and days in milk and randomly assigned to 1 of 5 diets that were fed continuously for 12 wk. Diets contained (dry matter basis) 48{\%} AS, 16{\%} AS plus 32{\%} of 1 of 3 BFT silages with 0.5, 0.8, or 1.5{\%} CT, or 48{\%} of an equal mixture of each BFT silage. Diets averaged 16.5{\%} crude protein and 30{\%} neutral detergent fiber. Intake and milk yield tended to be lower on AS than BFT, but body weight gains averaged 0.6 kg/d on all diets. Cows fed any of the BFT silages had reduced milk urea nitrogen and ruminal ammonia and reduced urinary N excretion. Feeding the BFT mixture reduced concentra-tions of milk true protein and milk urea nitrogen and depressed apparent nutrient digestibility. Among diets containing the individual BFT silages, linear reductions in DMI and yield of milk, fat, true protein, lactose, and SNF were observed with increasing CT concentration. By contrast, a previous trial with the same BFT popula-tions showed that substituting BFTH silage containing 1.6{\%} CT for AS in rations containing 60{\%} silage dry matter had no effect on intake, increased yield of milk, energy-corrected milk and milk components, elevated protein use-efficiency, but with a more modest reduc-tion in milk urea nitrogen and urinary N excretion. Si-lage analyses suggested that the inconsistent responses among trials were related to growth environment or ensiling effects that altered tannin-protein interactions in BFT silage. Differences in diet formulation among trials may have also influenced responses. Results from the current and previous trials indicate further work is needed to identify optimum tannin levels in forages.},

abstract = {Negative energy balance-related metabolic disorders suggest that the balance between available lipogenic and glucogenic nutrients is important. The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of a glucogenic or a lipogenic diet on liver triacylglycerides (TAG), metabolites, and metabolic hormones in dairy cows in early lactation and to relate metabolite concentrations to the determined energy retention in body mass (ER). Sixteen dairy cows were fed either a lipogenic or glucogenic diet from wk 3 prepartum to wk 9 postpartum (pp) and were housed in climate respiration chambers from wk 2 to 9 pp. Diets were isocaloric (net energy basis). Postpartum, cows fed a lipogenic diet tended to have higher nonesterified fatty acid concentration (NEFA; 0.46 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.37 +/- 0.04 mmol/L) and lower insulin concentration (4.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.6 microIU/mL). No difference was found in plasma glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, insulin-like growth factor-I, and thyroid hormones. Liver TAG was equal between both diets in wk -2 and 2 pp. In wk 4 pp cows fed the glucogenic diet had numerically lower TAG levels, although there was no significant dietary effect. Negative relationships were detected between ER and milk fat and between ER and NEFA. A positive relationship was detected between ER and insulin concentration. Overall, results suggest that insulin plays a regulating role in altering energy partitioning between milk and body tissue. Feeding lactating dairy cows a glucogenic diet decreased mobilization of body fat compared with a lipogenic diet. The relative abundance of lipogenic nutrients, when feeding a more lipogenic diet, is related to more secretion of lipogenic nutrients in milk, lower plasma insulin, and higher plasma NEFA concentration.},

abstract = {Tropical corn silage was compared with sorghum silage as a basal forage in the diets of high producing dairy cows. Sorghum and tropical corn silages were each included in place of ground corn at incremental concentrations in the experimental diets. Eight separate diets were fed, four diets containing each silage ranging in forage neutral detergent fiber (NDF) from approximately 25 to 31{\%} and ranging in total NDF from approximately 41 to 45{\%}. Diets were arranged in a 2 x 4 factorial design and were fed to lactating cows (n = 24; pretrial mean milk production = 39 kg/d; body weight = 656 kg; and days in milk = 81). As concentrations of dietary NDF increased, intake and milk production decreased linearly. The impact of dietary NDF on intake was greater for diets based on tropical corn silage than for diets based on sorghum silage. Energy intake and milk production were reduced, but cows consumed more fiber when challenged with higher dietary concentrations of fiber. The in vitro rate and extent of digestion of dietary samples were correlated with intake response. The rate of in vitro fiber digestion was slower for samples that contained tropical corn silage than for samples that contained sorghum silage. In vivo digestibility measurements were influenced by intake and dietary composition. Results of this trial indicated that sorghum silage can have equal or slightly greater nutritional value than tropical corn silage when these forages are fed at equal concentrations of dietary fiber.},

abstract = {A 6×6 Latin square design was used to test 3 sets of comparisons simultaneously to study response in dry matter intake, milk yield, and blood parameters to propylene glycol (PG) supplementation delivered by 2 methods [incorporating PG into the total mixed ration (TMR) vs. top dressing; comparison I]; individual or combined dietary choline and PG supplementation as a 2×2 factorial (comparison II); or increasing amounts of dietary choline (comparison III). Six multiparous (lactation number=1.5±0.8 SD) Holstein dairy cows were at 41 d in milk (±9 SD) at the start of the experiment. Propylene glycol used was a dry product containing 65{\%} PG, and choline was a rumen-protected choline product (RPC; estimated to be 50{\%} rumen-protected) containing 50{\%} choline chloride. In comparison I, treatments compared were 1) control: no PG; 2) PG-TMR: 250g/d of dry PG (corresponding to 162.5g/d of PG) incorporated into the TMR; and 3) PG-top dress: 250g/d of dry PG top-dressed onto the TMR. In comparison II, treatments compared were 1) control: no PG and no RPC; 2) PG: 250g/d of dry PG incorporated into the TMR; 3) RPC: 50g/d of RPC top-dressed onto the TMR; and 4) PG+RPC: combination of treatments 2 and 3. In comparison III, treatments compared were 0, 25, and 50g/d of RPC top-dressed onto the TMR. Each experimental period lasted 10 d with 9 d of adaptation followed by 1 d of serial blood sampling. Dry matter intake and milk yield were recorded daily. During the serial blood sampling, jugular blood was sampled every 20min for the first 4h and at 8 and 12h after treatment administration. Results obtained from comparison I showed that feeding 250g/d of PG as a dry product decreased plasma $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentration (mean±SEM) from 701±81 (control) to 564±76$\mu$mol/L without affecting serum insulin, plasma glucose, or plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations. Top-dressing PG decreased plasma BHBA concentrations more than by incorporating it into the TMR [527 vs. 601$\mu$mol/L (± 81 pooled SEM)]. Results obtained from comparison II showed that supplementing choline as RPC, PG, or both had no effect on dry matter intake, milk yield, or any of the blood parameters measured. Results obtained from comparison III showed that milk yield tended to increase linearly with increasing amounts of dietary choline as RPC. We concluded that feeding PG as a dry product reduced plasma BHBA concentration but top-dressing PG was more efficient at reducing plasma BHBA level than incorporating PG into the TMR. Dietary choline as RPC tended to increase milk yield linearly. However, a combined effect of dietary PG and choline was not evident and therefore not beneficial.},

abstract = {The objectives of the present study were to determine the effects of rumen undegradable protein (RUP) level of prepartum diets, the supplementation of a rumen-protected choline product, and their interactions on milk production, feed intake, body weight and condition, blood metabolites, and liver triacylglycerides in dairy cows. Rumen-protected choline (RPC) was fed with two levels of RUP to 48 multiparous Holstein cows in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Beginning 28 d before expected calving, cows were fed 10{\%} rumen degradable protein, either 0, 6, or 12 g/d of RPC as CapShure (Balchem Corp., Slate Hill, NY) and either 4.0 or 6.2{\%} RUP. After calving and through 120 d of lactation, cows received a common diet and continued RPC as per their prepartum assignment. Prepartum dry matter intake (kg/d) was not affected by RPC or RUP. Postpartum intake decreased when 6.2{\%} RUP was fed prepartum. Milk production to 56 d in milk was decreased when cows were fed 6.2{\%} RUP prepartum. Milk protein (kg/d) decreased when additional RUP was fed prepartum. Cows fed RPC lost more weight during the study period and tended to lose more body condition. Plasma urea nitrogen levels in the prepartum period were reduced for cows fed 4.0{\%} RUP prepartum. Mean liver triacylglyceride determined from samples obtained at -28, -14, +1, +28, and +56 d in milk was not affected by RPC, prepartum RUP, or their combinations. Feeding 12 g of RPC/d in conjunction with 4.0{\%} RUP increased milk production, but feeding RPC with 6.2{\%} RUP prepartum and through 56 d in milk decreased production. The data indicate that 6.2{\%} RUP does not benefit close-up dry cows, and the response to RPC depends the RUP content of the prepartum diet.},

Dry matter intake was reduced by infusion of soy lecithin as compared with infusion of water (18.1 and 21.1 kg/d, respectively). Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration was increased when cows received the myo-inositol or soy lecithin infusion, and plasma glucose was lower when cows received the choline or soy lecithin treatment. Infusion of soy lecithin caused approximately a twofold increase in plasma triglyceride-rich lipoprotein concentration. Milk fat percentage and milk fat yield were greater during soy lecithin infusion (3.54{\%}, 1.11 kg/d) than during water (3.09{\%}, .98 kg/d) or soy oil (3.06{\%}, .98 kg/d) infusion. This resulted in greater 3.5{\%} FCM yield during soy lecithin infusion (31.6 kg/d) than during water (29.5 kg/d) or soy oil (29.6 kg/d) infusion. Infusion of phospholipid with triglyceride allowed more fatty acid to be infused without causing diarrhea. Infusion of triglyceride in the presence of phospholipid increased milk fat synthesis whereas infusion of triglyceride alone did not.},

eastern Slovakia and to determine experimentally the optimum dose for
adequate disinfection in terms of devitalisation of potential pathogens
while observing the limit for residual active chlorine (0.3 mg/l) in
drinking water. Our investigations included bacteriological examination
focused on general contamination and indicator bacteria (bacteria
cultivated at 22 and 37 degrees C, total coliforms, E. coli,
enterococci), physico-chemical examination (pH, ammonium ions, nitrites,
nitrates, chlorides, free chlorine, chemical oxygen demand CODMn and Ca

which focused on the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). After
determining the optimum single dose of Chloramine T for disinfection of
water used for watering of animals, the bacteriological quality of water
was checked on the 5th day after the disinfection. The results showed
that water quality was better on Farm No. 3 than on Farms No. 1 and No.
2. The weather (precipitation) evidently affected the quality of water
on all three farms and was associated with some risk to animals
consuming this water. The experimentally determined doses of Chloramine
T appeared relatively efficient on Farm No. 1 and Farm No. 3, while the
Chloramine T dose estimated for adequate disinfection on Farm No. 2 had
to be increased considerably but was still much lower than the dose
recommended by the manufacturer of this preparation. It appeared
effective to adjust the intervals between individual chlorine treatments
according to weather conditions (heavy rain) instead of increasing the
active chlorine dose.},

abstract = {A study was conducted to determine if subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) induced by feeding alfalfa pellets results in increases in free bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rumen fluid and peripheral blood, and acute phase proteins in plasma, and to determine the effect of alfalfa pellet-induced SARA on feed intake, rumen fermentation characteristics, milk production and composition, and blood metabolites. Eight lactating Holstein cows, 4 of which were ruminally cannulated, were used in a 6-wk experiment and were fed once daily at 0900 h. During wk 1, cows received a diet containing 50{\%} of DM as concentrate and 50{\%} of DM chopped alfalfa hay. Between wk 2 and wk 6, alfalfa hay was gradually replaced with alfalfa pellets at the rate of 8{\%} per week to reduce rumen pH. Rumen pH was monitored continuously in the ruminally cannulated cows using indwelling pH probes. Rumen fluid and peripheral blood were sampled 15 min before feed delivery and at 6 h after feed delivery. Based on adopted threshold of SARA of at least 180 min/d below pH 5.6, SARA was induced from wk 3 onwards. Replacing 40{\%} of alfalfa hay with alfalfa pellets quadratically increased the DMI from 18.1 kg/d in wk 1 to 23.4 kg/d in wk 6. This replacement linearly decreased milk yield (32.7 vs. 35.9 kg/d) and milk fat percentage and yield (2.32 vs. 3.22{\%}, and 0.77 vs. 1.14 kg/d, respectively), but increased milk protein percentage and yield (3.80 vs. 3.04{\%}, and 1.23 vs. 1.07 kg/d, respectively). This gradual replacement also linearly increased the daily averages of total volatile fatty acids (90 to 121.9 mM), acetate (53.9 to 66.8 mM), propionate (21.5 to 39.6 mM), and osmolality (277.7 to 293.8 mmol/kg) in the rumen and decreased the acetate to propionate ratio from 2.62 to 1.73. Replacing alfalfa hay with alfalfa pellets linearly increased blood lactate from 1.00 mM in wk 1 to a peak of 3.46 mM in wk 5. Induction of SARA in this study increased free rumen LPS concentration from 42,122 endotoxin unit (EU)/mL in wk 1 to 145,593 EU/mL in wk 6. However, this increase was not accompanied by an increase in LPS ({\textless}0.05 EU/mL) and in acute phase proteins serum amyloid-A, haptoglobin, and LPS-binding protein in peripheral circulation. Results suggest that SARA induced by alfalfa pellets increased LPS in the rumen without causing translocation of LPS and an immune response.},

abstract = {This study examined the effects of red clover or grass silages cut at 2 stages of growth on feed intake, cell wall digestion, and ruminal passage kinetics in lactating dairy cows. Five dairy cows equipped with rumen cannulas were used in a study designed as a 5×5 Latin square with 21-d periods. Diets consisted of early-cut and late-cut grass and red clover silages and a mixture of late-cut grass and early-cut red clover silages offered ad libitum. All diets were supplemented with 9 kg/d of concentrate. Ruminal digestion and passage kinetics were assessed by the rumen evacuation technique. Apparent total-tract digestibility was determined by total fecal collection. The silage dry matter intake was highest when the mixed forage diet was fed and lowest with the early-cut red clover diet. Delaying the harvest tended to decrease DMI of grass and increase that of red clover. The intake of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and potentially digestible NDF (pdNDF) was lower but the intake of indigestible NDF (iNDF) was higher for red clover diets than for grass diets. The rumen pool size of iNDF and the ratio of iNDF to pdNDF in the rumen contents were larger, and pool sizes of NDF and pdNDF were smaller for red clover than for grass silage diets. Outflow of iNDF and the ratio of iNDF to pdNDF in digesta entering the omasal canal were larger, and the outflow of pdNDF was smaller for red clover than for grass silage diets. The digestion rate (kd) of pdNDF was faster for red clover diets than for grass silage diets. Delaying the harvest decreased kd for grass but increased it for red clover silage diets. Observed differences in fiber characteristics of red clover and grass silages were reflected in ruminal digestion and passage kinetics of these forages. The low intake of early-cut red clover silage could not be explained by silage digestibility, fermentation quality, or rumen fill, but was most likely related to nutritionally suboptimal composition because inclusion of moderate quality grass silage improved silage intake. Increasing the maturity of ensiled red clover does not seem to affect silage dry matter intake as consistently as that of grasses.},

Treatments were (1) 75mg of supplemental zinc/kg of dry matter (DM) provided entirely as zinc sulfate (0-CZ); (2) 0-CZ diet, except 33.3mg of zinc sulfate/kg of DM in the prepartum and 15.5mg of zinc sulfate/kg of DM in the postpartum diet were replaced by CZ from Availa-Zn (16-CZ; Zinpro Corp., Eden Prairie MN); and (3) 0-CZ diet, except 66.6mg of zinc sulfate/kg of DM in the prepartum and 40.0mg of zinc sulfate/kg of DM in the postpartum diet was replaced by Availa-Zn (40-CZ). Cows were housed at the Iowa State University Dairy Farm and were individually offered a total mixed ration containing dietary treatments beginning at 28±15d before expected calving date until 250 d in milk. Relative to 0-CZ, multiparous cows (but not primiparous) fed CZ (16-CZ or 40-CZ) had increased (20{\%}) colostrum IgG concentrations. Prepartum DM intake (DMI) was decreased with CZ supplementation. Postpartum DMI was decreased in cows fed CZ, whereas milk yield (MY) was increased in the 40-CZ-fed cows relative to those fed both 0-CZ and 16-CZ. Feed efficiency increased linearly when measured as MY/DMI, 3.5{\%} fat-corrected MY/DMI, and solids-corrected MY/DMI. Regardless of level, feeding CZ decreased services per conception. Feeding 16-CZ decreased milk fat concentration and feeding CZ linearly increased milk urea nitrogen concentration.

abstract = {To evaluate the effect of soybeans roasted at different temperatures on milk yield and milk fatty acid composition, 8 (4 multiparous and 4 primiparous) mid-lactation Holstein cows (42.9 ± 3 kg/d of milk) were assigned to a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. The control diet (CON) contained lignosulfonate-treated soybean meal (as a source of rumen-undegradable protein) and calcium salts of fatty acids (Ca-FA, as a source of energy). Diets 2, 3, and 4 contained ground soybeans roasted at 115, 130, or 145°C, respectively (as the source of protein and energy). Dry matter intake (DMI) tended to be greater for CON compared with the roasted soybean diets (24.6 vs. 23.3 kg/d). Apparent total-tract digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein were not different among the treatments. Actual and 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk yield were greater for CON than for the roasted soybean diets. Milk fat was higher for soybeans roasted at 130°C than for those roasted at either 115 or 145°C. No differences were observed between the CON and the roasted soybean diets, or among roasting temperatures, on feed efficiency and nitrogen concentrations in rumen, milk, and plasma. Milk from cows fed roasted soybeans had more long-chain fatty acids and fewer medium-chain fatty acids than milk from cows fed Ca-FA. Compared with milk from cows fed the CON diet, total milk fat contents of conjugated linoleic acid, cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid, cis-C18:2, cis-C18:3, and C22:0 were higher for cows fed the roasted soybean diets. Polyunsaturated fatty acids and total unsaturated fatty acids were greater in milk from cows fed roasted soybean diets than in milk from cows fed CON. Concentrations of C16:0 and saturated fatty acids in milk fat were greater for CON than for the roasted soybean diets. Cows fed roasted soybean diets had lower atherogenic and thrombogenic indices than cows fed CON. Milk fatty acid composition did not differ among different roasting temperatures. In summary, results showed that cows fed CON had higher DMI and milk yield than cows fed roasted soybean diets. Among different roasting temperatures (115, 130, and 145°C), soybeans roasted at 115°C led to higher milk production and lower DMI. Cows fed roasted soybeans, regardless of the roasting temperature, had more unsaturated fatty acids in milk. Using roasted soybeans in dairy cow rations could, therefore, improve the health indices of milk for human nutrition.},

Eighteen beef steers (Simmental??Luxi) with an initial body weight (means??standard deviation) of 335??7.5. kg and similar body condition were randomly assigned to one of three treatments for 50 days in a completely randomized design. The treatments consisted of (1) the basal diet (control), (2) the basal diet+2. g/kg MMT, and (3) the basal diet+2. g/kg YCW on a dry matter basis. Fecal grab samples were collected for five consecutive days on days 41-45 after the morning feeding; jugular vein blood was collected on day 45 before the morning feeding, and beef steers were slaughtered at the end of the 50-day trial and dissected to collect samples of ruminal fluid and digesta of different intestinal sectors (the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon). Results showed that dietary MMT supplementation decreased (P{\textless}0.05) free LPS concentrations in plasma, feces, and the digesta of different sectors of the gastrointestinal tract except the cecum. Dietary YCW supplementation decreased (P{\textless}0.05) free LPS concentrations in plasma, feces, and the digesta of the lower gut including the ileum, cecum and colon. Correspondingly, the levels of acute phase proteins (serum amyloid-A, haptoglobin, C-reactive protein, and LPS-binding protein) in plasma were also decreased (P{\textless}0.05) by dietary supplementation of MMT and YCW. Dietary supplementation of YCW increased (P{\textless}0.05) apparent digestibilities of acid detergent fiber and total phosphorus and improved (P{\textless}0.05) average daily gain and feed efficiency. Dietary supplementation of MMT only improved feed efficiency (P{\textless}0.05). Results suggest dietary supplementation of MMT and YCW can effectively bind LPS in the digestive tract, reduce the translocation of LPS from the digestive tract into the circulation, and thus improve growth performance in beef cattle. Dietary supplementation of YCW at a dose of 2. g/kg was more effective than that of MMT at the same dose in reducing plasma acute phase protein levels and in improving growth performance. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Forty-five multiparous and 18 primiparous Holstein cows were fed three levels of crude protein (CP), each at three levels of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), to identify optimal dietary CP and energy. Cows were blocked by parity and days in milk into seven groups of nine and randomly assigned to an incomplete 9 x 9 Latin square trial with four, 4-wk periods. Diets were formulated from alfalfa and corn silages, high-moisture corn, soybean meal, minerals, and vitamins. Forage was 60{\%} alfalfa and 40{\%} corn silage on all diets; NDF contents of 36, 32, and 28{\%} were obtained by feeding 75, 63, and 50{\%} forage, respectively. Dietary CP contents of 15.1, 16.7, and 18.4{\%} were obtained by replacing high-moisture corn with soybean meal. Production data were from the last 2 wk of each period. Spot fecal and urine samples were collected from 36 cows to estimate N excretion using fecal indigestible acid detergent fiber (ADF) and urinary creatinine as markers. There were no interactions (P {\textgreater} or = 0.08) between dietary CP and NDF for any trait; thus, effects of CP were not confounded by NDF or vice versa. Intake of DM and fat yield were lower on 15.1{\%} CP than at higher CP. There were linear increases in milk urea and urinary N excretion and linear decreases in N efficiency with increasing CP. Increasing CP from 15.1 to 18.4{\%} reduced milk N from 31 to 25{\%} of dietary N, increased urinary N from 23 to 35{\%} of dietary N, and reduced fecal N from 45 to 41{\%} of dietary N. Decreasing NDF gave linear increases in BW gain, yield of milk, protein, true protein, lactose, and SNF, and milk/DM intake and milk N/N intake, and linear decreases in milk urea. However, fat yield was lower on 28{\%} than 32{\%} NDF. Reducing NDF from 36 to 28{\%} increased purine derivative excretion by 19{\%}, suggesting increased microbial protein. Increasing CP by adding soybean meal to diets fed cows averaging 34 kg/d of milk increased intake and fat yield but depressed N efficiency. Increasing dietary energy by reducing forage improved milk yield and efficiency and decreased excretion of environmentally labile urinary N.},

abstract = {This study was designed to determine the effect of adding a molasses-based liquid feed (LF) supplement to a total mixed ration (TMR) on the feed sorting behavior and production of dairy cows. Twelve lactating Holstein cows (88.2±19.5 DIM) were exposed, in a crossover design with 21-d periods, to each of 2 treatment diets: 1) control TMR and 2) control TMR with 4.1{\%} dietary dry matter LF added. Dry matter intake (DMI), sorting, and milk yield were recorded for the last 7 d of each treatment period. Milk samples were collected for composition analysis for the last 3 d of each treatment period; these data were used to calculate 4{\%} fat-corrected milk and energy-corrected milk yield. Sorting was determined by subjecting fresh feed and orts samples to particle separation and expressing the actual intake of each particle fraction as a percentage of the predicted intake of that fraction. Addition of LF did not noticeably change the nutrient composition of the ration, with the exception of an expected increase in dietary sugar concentration (from 4.0 to 5.4{\%}). Liquid feed supplementation affected the particle size distribution of the ration, resulting in a lesser amount of short and a greater amount of fine particles. Cows sorted against the longest ration particles on both treatment diets; the extent of this sorting was greater on the control diet (55.0 vs. 68.8{\%}). Dry matter intake was 1.4 kg/d higher when cows were fed the LF diet as compared with the control diet, resulting in higher acid-detergent fiber, neutral-detergent fiber, and sugar intakes. As a result of the increased DMI, cows tended to produce 1.9 kg/d more milk and produced 3.1 and 3.2 kg/d more 4{\%} fat-corrected milk and energy-corrected milk, respectively, on the LF diet. As a result, cows tended to produce more milk fat (0.13 kg/d) and produced more milk protein (0.09 kg/d) on the LF diet. No difference between treatments was observed in the efficiency of milk production. Overall, adding a molasses-based LF to TMR can be used to decrease feed sorting, enhance DMI, and improve milk yield.},

abstract = {The goal of this experiment was to investigate the effect of yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) on rumen fermentation, nutrient utilization, and ammonia and methane emission from manure in dairy cows. Eight ruminally cannulated Holstein cows were allocated to 2 dietary treatments in a crossover design. Treat-ments were control (no yeast culture) and XP (yeast culture, fed at 56 g/head per day; XP, Diamond V Mills Inc., Cedar Rapids, IA). Dry matter intake, milk yield, milk composition, and body weight were similar between treatments. Milk urea nitrogen concentration was also not affected by treatment. Rumen pH was similar between the control and XP treatments, but rumen ammonia concentration tended to be lower with XP than with the control. Treatment had no effect on concentrations of total or individual volatile fatty acids, protozoal counts, polysaccharide-degrading activities (except amylase activity that tended to be increased by XP), or methane production in the rumen. Urinary N losses did not differ significantly between treatments, but allantoin and total purine derivative excretions and the estimated microbial N outflow from the ru-men tended to be increased by XP compared with the control treatment. Total-tract apparent digestibility of dietary nutrients was not affected by XP. Milk fatty acid composition was also not altered by XP supple-mentation. Cumulative (253 h) ammonia and methane emissions from manure, measured in a steady-state gas emission system, were slightly decreased by XP. Over-all, the yeast culture tested had little effect on ruminal fermentation, digestibility, or N losses, but tended to reduce rumen ammonia concentration and increase mi-crobial protein synthesis in the rumen, and decreased ammonia and methane emissions from manure.},

The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of feed push-up frequency on the behavioral patterns of dairy cows, and to determine associations between behavior and milk yield and composition. Lactating Holstein dairy cows (n = 28, parity = 1.9 ± 1.1; mean ± SD) were housed in tiestalls, milked twice per day, and offered ad libitum access to water and a total mixed ration (containing, on a dry matter basis: 25{\%} corn silage, 25{\%} grass/alfalfa haylage, 30{\%} high-moisture corn, and 20{\%} protein/mineral supplement), provided twice per day. Cows were divided into 2 groups of 14 (balanced by days in milk, milk production, and parity) and individually exposed to each of 2 treatments in a crossover design with 21-d periods; treatment 1 had infrequent feed push-up (3×/d), whereas treatment 2 had frequent feed push-up (5×/d). During the last 7 d of each period, dry matter intake and milk production were recorded and lying behavior was monitored using electronic data loggers. During the last 2 d of each period, milk samples were collected for analysis of protein and fat content and feed samples of fresh feed and orts were collected for particle size analysis. The particle size separator had 3 screens (19, 8, and 1.18 mm) and a bottom pan, resulting in 4 fractions (long, medium, short, fine). Sorting was calculated as the actual intake of each particle size fraction expressed as a percentage of the predicted intake of that fraction. Feed push-up frequency had no effect on lying time [11.4 ± 0.37 h/d; mean ± standard error (SE)], milk production (40.2 ± 1.28 kg/d) and composition (milk protein: 3.30 ± 0.048{\%}; milk fat: 3.81 ± 0.077{\%}), or feed sorting. Cows sorted against long particles (78.0 ± 2.2{\%}) and for short (102.6 ± 0.6{\%}) and fine (108.4 ± 0.9{\%}) particles. Milk fat content decreased by 0.1 percentage points for every 10{\%} increase in sorting against long particles and was not associated with lying behavior or other cow-level factors. Milk protein content decreased by 0.03 percentage points for every hour decrease in lying time and by 0.04 percentage points for every 10{\%} increase in sorting against long particles. These results suggest that sorting against long ration particles may negatively affect milk composition. Additionally, we did not find that altering feed push-up frequency affected feed sorting or cow standing and lying patterns.},

abstract = {Total mixed rations containing corn (CS), whole plant grain sorghum (WPGS), or forage sorghum (FS) silages were fed to 6 primiparous Italian Friesian cows to determine the effects on lactation performance, nutrient digestibility, and N balance. Furthermore, the relationship between in vivo total-tract neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility (ttNDFD) and the ttNDFD derived by the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) model was assessed. Cows were assigned to 1 of 3 diets in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square with 28-d periods. The experimental treatment was silage type and 3 different silages were included in the diets. The diets were formulated to be iso-NDF. Accordingly, each diet was formulated to contain 41.5{\%} CS silage, 36.7{\%} WPGS silage, or 28.0{\%} FS silage, on a DM basis. Starch content was balanced by adding the appropriate amount of corn meal. Separate collection of total urine and feces was performed. Dietary forages were analyzed for in vitro NDF digestibility (6 and 24h of incubation) to predict fiber digestion rate with 2 NDF pools (digestible and indigestible). Rumen digestibility of the potentially digestible NDF pool was predicted using CNCPS version 6.1, using the in vitro forage fiber digestion rate. The ttNDFD was predicted assuming that intestinal digestibility of the NDF amount escaping rumen digestion was 20{\%}, according to the CNCPS model. Dry matter intake was decreased by approximately 1.8 kg/d in cows fed the FS diet compared with the other diets, probably for the greater particle size of FS diet. Hence, milk yield (kg/d) was lowest for FS (23.6), intermediate for WPGS (24.6), and highest for the CS diet (25.4). Milk urea N (mg/dL) was highest for FS (12.9), intermediate for WPGS (11.9), and lowest for CS (10.7) diet. In vivo ttNDFD ({\%}) was 51.4 (CS), 48.6 (WPGS), and 54.1 (FS); this was probably due to a higher retention time of FS diet in the rumen rather than to a better quality of the FS silage, as confirmed by in situ and in vitro results. Urinary N excretion ({\%} N intake) was highest for FS (31.8), intermediate for WPGS (29.3), and lowest for the CS (27.5) diet. The predicted ttNDFD (37.7, 36.3, and 39.5{\%} for CS, WPGS, and FS, respectively) were lower than the in vivo results. Providing an adequate starch supplementation, whole plant grain sorghum silage can replace corn silage in dairy cows TMR. Forage sorghum silage had rumen NDF digestibility comparable to the other silages; however, it had a negative effect on dry matter intake and milk production, probably due to an inadequate effect of processing.},

abstract = {The effect of increasing CP levels by additions of cottonseed meal to diets for early lactation was studied in 24 multiparous Holstein cows. Diets containing 13.8, 17.5, 20.4, and 23.9{\%} CP were fed during three 3-wk periods beginning at wk 4 postpartum. Each cow received three of the four dietary treatments giving 18 observations per treatment in a randomized complete block design. Undegraded intake protein as a fraction of total protein for the diets was .25, .32, .36, and .39. Dry matter intake increased linearly with increasing dietary CP concentrations. Daily milk yield increased as dietary CP increased from 13.8 to 17.5{\%}. Increased milk yield was accompanied by increased daily yields of milk fat and protein, but the concentration of these components in milk was not altered. The proportion of total milk N that was NPN increased linearly with increasing dietary CP level. Plasma amino acids and urea N were increased by increasing the dietary CP level. The conclusions of the study were that increasing dietary CP levels from 13.8 to 17.5{\%} by the use of cottonseed meal was beneficial to cows consuming alfalfa-based diets in early lactation. Increasing dietary CP above 17.5{\%} showed little benefit in milk yield. Increasing dietary protein caused an increase in blood urea N and milk NPN, indicating N wastage by the animal.},

abstract = {Diets based on red clover silage (RCS) typically increase the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in ruminant milk and meat compared with grass silages (GS), an effect that has been attributed to higher activity of polyphenol oxidase in red clover, promoting ruminal escape of dietary lipid. Four multiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows in mid lactation fitted with rumen cannulas were used in a 4×4 Latin Square design with 21-d experimental periods to evaluate the effects of incremental replacement of GS with RCS on ruminal lipid metabolism, using the omasal sampling technique in combination with Cr-EDTA, Yb acetate, and indigestible neutral detergent fiber as markers. Treatments comprised total mixed rations offered ad libitum containing 600 g of forage/kg of diet dry matter, with RCS replacing GS in a ratio of 0:100, 33:67, 67:33, and 100:0 on a dry matter basis. Silages contained a high proportion of lipid as nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), with no difference between forage species (75 and 73{\%} for GS and RCS, respectively). Substitution of GS with RCS had no influence on the intakes of NEFA, polar lipid, triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, or total fatty acids (FA), but altered the ingestion of specific FA. Replacing GS with RCS decreased linearly 18:3n-3 and increased linearly 18:2n-6 intakes. Changes in the proportion of RCS in the diet had no effect on the amounts or on the relative proportions of different lipid fractions at the omasum. On average, NEFA, polar lipid, triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and monoacylglycerol accounted for 80, 12, 4.4, 2.4, and 0.8{\%} of total FA in omasal digesta, respectively. Replacement of GS with RCS increased linearly the amount of esterified and nonesterified 18:3n-3 at the omasum. Flows of cis-9 18:1 and 18:2n-6 were also increased linearly in response to RCS in the diet, whereas 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-16:0 at the omasum was decreased. Replacing GS with RCS in the diet decreased linearly the lipolysis of dietary esterified lipids in the rumen from 85 to 70{\%}. Effects on lipolysis due to forage species were also associated with linear decreases in apparent ruminal 18:3n-3 biohydrogenation from 93 to 85{\%} and a trend toward lowered biohydrogenation of cis-9 18:1 and 18:2n-6 in the rumen. However, forage species had no effect on the flow of bound phenols formed as a consequence of polyphenol oxidase activity at the omasum. In conclusion, despite minimal differences in the extent of lipolysis in silo, lipid and constituent FA in RCS were less susceptible to ruminal lipolysis and biohydrogenation compared with GS.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the effects of monensin (M) supplementation on lactation performance of dairy cows fed diets of either reduced (RS) or normal (NS) starch concentrations as total mixed rations. One hundred twenty-eight Holstein and Holstein × Jersey cows (90±33 d in milk) were stratified by breed and parity and randomly assigned to 16 pens of 8 cows each in a randomized controlled trial. Pens were then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. A 4-wk covariate adjustment period preceded the treatment period, with all pens receiving NS supplemented with 18g of monensin/t of dry matter (DM). Following the 4-wk covariate adjustment period, cows were fed their assigned treatment diets of NS with M (18g of monensin/t), NS with 0g of monensin/t (C), RS with M, or RS with C for 12 wk. Actual starch concentrations for the RS and NS diets were 20.4 and 26.9{\%} (DM basis), respectively. Mean dry matter intake (DMI; 27.0kg/d) was unaffected by the treatments. Feeding M compared with C and NS compared with RS increased milk yield by 1.3 and 1.5kg/d per cow, respectively. Milk protein percentage and yield and lactose yield were increased and milk urea nitrogen was decreased for NS compared with RS. Feeding M increased actual and component-corrected milk feed efficiencies (component-corrected milk yield/DMI) and lactose yield and tended to increase milk urea nitrogen compared with C. Milk protein percentage was decreased for M compared with C, but milk fat percentage and yield, protein yield, and lactose percentage were unaffected by M. We observed a tendency for a starch × monensin interaction for milk feed efficiency (actual milk yield/DMI); M tended to increase efficiency more for NS than for RS. Starch and monensin had minimal effects on milk fatty acid composition and yields. Feeding RS decreased milk and protein yields, but component-corrected milk yields and feed efficiencies were similar for RS and NS. Monensin increased feed efficiency and lactation performance for both dietary starch concentrations.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of oral acidogenic mineral boluses (196 g) containing anionic salts to facilitate the transition from lactation to the dry stage by inducing a mild and temporary metabolic acidosis at dry-off. In experiment 1, 84 lactating cows were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatment groups consisting of an oral administration of 0, 1, or 2 boluses 5 d before dry-off to evaluate the effects on milk production. In experiment 2, 16 lactating cows were involved in a crossover study to evaluate the effects of the administration of 2 boluses on milk production, feed intake, and urine pH. In experiment 3, 152 lactating cows were allocated to 1 of 2 treatments (control: no treatment; bolus: 2 oral boluses the day before last milking) to evaluate udder pressure, incidence of milk leakage, and lying behavior during the first days following dry-off. Also, milk yield in the subsequent lactation for all enrolled cows was recorded during the first 60 DIM. In experiment 1, cows receiving 2 boluses had the greatest reduction in milk production (-2.56 kg/d of milk) compared with those receiving 1 bolus or no treatment (-1.15 and -0.23 kg/d, respectively) the second day after bolus application. In experiment 2, the application of oral boluses decreased feed intake of cows during the first 3 d following treatment, and milk production was reduced on d 2 and 3 after bolus application. Reduced urine pH at 8 and 24 h after treatment was observed in bolus cows compared with control cows. In experiment 3, bolus cows had lower udder pressure after drying off, but incidence of milk leakage did not differ between treatments. Bolus cows had an additional 85 min of lying time in the 24 h following dry-off. Serum P and $\beta$-OH-butyrate concentrations were lower in bolus cows than in control cows after dry-off, but no other differences in blood parameters between treatments were observed. Also, no differences in milk yield in the subsequent lactation were observed between treatments. It is concluded that oral bolus application diminishes feed intake and milk production, and, if applied at dry-off, it decreases udder pressure and increases lying time during the first 24 h after dry-off.},

abstract = {The effects of palmitic acid supplementation on feed intake, digestibility, and metabolic and production responses were evaluated in dairy cows with a wide range of milk production (34.5 to 66.2 kg/d) in a crossover design experiment with a covariate period. Thirty-two multiparous Holstein cows (151 ± 66 d in milk) were randomly assigned to treatment sequence within level of milk production. Treatments were diets supplemented (2{\%} of diet DM) with palmitic acid (PA; 99{\%} C16:0) or control (SH; soyhulls). Treatment periods were 21 d, with the final 4 d used for data and sample collection. Immediately before the first treatment period, cows were fed the control diet for 21 d and baseline values were obtained for all variables (covariate period). Milk production measured during the covariate period (preliminary milk yield) was used as covariate. In general, no interactions were detected between treatment and preliminary milk yield for the response variables measured. The PA treatment increased milk fat percentage (3.40 vs. 3.29{\%}) and yields of milk (46.0 vs. 44.9 kg/d), milk fat (1.53 vs. 1.45 kg/d), and 3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk (44.6 vs. 42.9 kg/d), compared with SH. Concentrations and yields of protein and lactose were not affected by treatment. The PA treatment did not affect dry matter (DM) intake or body weight, tended to decrease body condition score (2.93 vs. 2.99), and increased feed efficiency (3.5{\%} fat-corrected milk/DM intake; 1.60 vs. 1.54), compared with SH. The PA treatment increased total-tract digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (39.0 vs.35.7{\%}) and organic matter (67.9 vs. 66.2{\%}), but decreased fatty acid (FA) digestibility (61.2 vs. 71.3{\%}). As total FA intake increased, total FA digestibility decreased (R(2) = 0.51) and total FA absorbed increased (quadratic R(2) = 0.82). Fatty acid yield response, calculated as the additional FA yield secreted in milk per unit of additional FA intake, was 11.7{\%} for total FA and 16.5{\%} for C16:0 plus cis-9 C16:1 FA. The PA treatment increased plasma concentration of nonesterified FA (101 vs. 90.0 $\mu$Eq/L) and cholecystokinin (19.7 vs. 17.6 pmol/L), and tended to increase plasma concentration of insulin (10.7 vs. 9.57 $\mu$ IU/mL). Results show that palmitic acid fed at 2{\%} of diet DM has the potential to increase yields of milk and milk fat, independent of production level without increasing body condition score or body weight. However, a small percentage of the supplemented FA was partitioned to milk.},

abstract = {Cows milked in pasture-based automatic milking systems (AMS) have greater milking intervals than cows milked in indoor AMS. Long milking intervals greater than 16h have a negative effect on milk yield and udder health. The impact of 2 systems of pasture allocation in AMS on milking interval and yield was investigated at the FutureDairy AMS research farm (Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute, New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, Camden, New South Wales, Australia) in late November to early December 2010. Two- (2WG) versus 3-way grazing (3WG) allocations per 24-h period were compared in a field study to test the hypothesis that an increase in the frequency of pasture allocation would reduce the milking interval and, therefore, increase milking frequency. The study involved the entire milking herd of 145 cows, with (mean ± SD) DIM=121±90d, 7-d average milking frequency=1.52±0.41 milkings/cow per day, and 7-d average milk yield=21.3±7.6kg/cow per day. Cows were milked using 2 DeLaval VMS milking units (DeLaval International AB, Tumba, Sweden). Cows in the 3WG treatment had 31{\%} reduced milking interval, 40{\%} greater milking frequency, and 20{\%} greater daily milk production compared with 2WG. Increased milking frequency and milk production for 3WG was associated with greater utililization levels of the AMS milking units throughout the day. These results support the recommendation that, wherever possible, farmers installing AMS should incorporate sufficient infrastructure to accommodate 3WG, which provides additional flexibility with managing extremely long (and short) milking intervals.},

Despite a large body of research, few practical and cost-effective farm-level interventions have been identified. In this study, a randomized controlled trial was con- ducted to assess the effect of reducing the level of water in automatically refilling water- troughs on fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in feedlot cattle. Pens in a feedlot in the Texas Panhandle were randomly allocated as control (total number: 17) or intervention (total num- ber: 18) pens. Fecal samples (2,759 in total) were collected both at baseline and three weeks after the intervention, and tested for the presence of E. coli O157:H7 using immuno- magnetic bead separation and selective culture. There was a strong statistical association between sampling date and the likelihood of a fecal sample testing positive for E. coli O157: H7. Pen was also a strong predictor of fecal prevalence. Despite accounting for this high level of clustering, a statistically significant association between reduced water levels in the trough and increased prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in the feces was observed (Odds Ratio = 1.6; 95{\%} Confidence Interval: 1.2–2.0; Likelihood Ratio Test: p = 0.02). This is the first time that such an association has been reported, and suggests that increasing water- trough levels may be effective in reducing shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle feces, although further work would be needed to test this hypothesis. Controlling E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding at the pre-harvest level may lead to a reduced burden of human foodborne ill- ness attributed to this pathogen in beef.},

abstract = {The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the effects of acidic pH of the perfusate and presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on permeability of rumen and colon mucosal tissues to mannitol and LPS using the Ussing chamber system. Rumen and colon tissues (n = 8), obtained from slaughtered feedlot steers, were tested for changes in permeability to (3)H-mannitol under pH of 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 for rumen and at 5.5, 6.5, and 7.4 for colon, with or without LPS from Escherichia coli B:055 at 500 microg/mL. The (3)H-Mannitol was added at 10 microL (525.4 GBq/mmol) on the mucosal side of the Ussing chamber to detect changes in permeability, and 4 samples were taken at 20, 25, 30, and 35 min from the serosal side. Permeability of rumen and colon mucosa to (3)H-mannitol increased 6- and 5-fold, respectively, at acidic pH values of 4.5 and 5.5 and in the presence of 500 micro/mL of LPS. In contrast, LPS did not affect rumen and colon permeability at pH that ranged from 5.5 and 7.4. Translocation of LPS across the rumen and colon mucosa of cattle was not pH dependent. The LPS translocated through these tissues if present at the mucosal side. In conclusion, the permeability of rumen and colon tissues to (3)H-mannitol increased in presence of LPS and under acidic pH, whereas LPS permeated through mucosal tissues independently of the pH of the perfusate. Further research is warranted to understand the mechanism(s) by which acidic pH of the rumen digesta and presence of LPS make rumen and colon tissues "leaky".},

abstract = {{\{}DNA{\}} methylation is assumed to be complementary on both alleles
across the genome, although there are exceptions, notably in regions
subject to genomic imprinting. {\{}W{\}}e present a genome-wide survey
of the degree of allelic skewing of {\{}DNA{\}} methylation with the aim
of identifying previously unreported differentially methylated regions
({\{}DMR{\}}s) associated primarily with genomic imprinting or {\{}DNA{\}} sequence
variation acting in cis. {\{}W{\}}e used {\{}SNP{\}} microarrays to quantitatively
assess allele-specific {\{}DNA{\}} methylation ({\{}ASM{\}}) in amplicons covering
7.6{\%} of the human genome following cleavage with a cocktail of methylation-sensitive
restriction enzymes ({\{}MSRE{\}}s). {\{}S{\}}elected findings were verified
using bisulfite-mapping and gene-expression analyses, subsequently
tested in a second tissue from the same individuals, and replicated
in {\{}DNA{\}} obtained from 30 parent-child trios. {\{}O{\}}ur approach detected
clear examples of {\{}ASM{\}} in the vicinity of known imprinted loci,
highlighting the validity of the method. {\{}I{\}}n total, 2,704 (1.5{\%})
of our 183,605 informative and stringently filtered {\{}SNP{\}}s demonstrate
an average relative allele score ({\{}RAS{\}}) change e0.10 following {\{}MSRE{\}}
digestion. {\{}I{\}}n agreement with previous reports, the majority of
{\{}ASM{\}} ({\textless}90{\%}) appears to be cis in nature, and several examples of
tissue-specific {\{}ASM{\}} were identified. {\{}O{\}}ur data show that {\{}ASM{\}}
is a widespread phenomenon, with {\textgreater}35,000 such sites potentially occurring
across the genome, and that a spectrum of {\{}ASM{\}} is likely, with heterogeneity
between individuals and across tissues. {\{}T{\}}hese findings impact our
understanding about the origin of individual phenotypic differences
and have implications for genetic studies of complex disease.},

abstract = {The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of GnRH early postpartum on induction of ovulation, uterine health, and fertility in dairy cows. Holstein cows without a corpus luteum (CL) at 17±3 DIM were assigned randomly to receive i.m. GnRH (n=245) at 17±3 and 20±3 DIM or remain as controls (n=245). Ovaries were scanned by ultrasonography twice weekly totaling 4 examinations. Ovulation was characterized by the appearance of a CL ≥20mm at any ultrasound or CL {\textless}20mm in 2 consecutive examinations. Clinical and cytological endometritis were diagnosed at 35 DIM. Compared with control, GnRH increased ovulation up to 3.5d after the last treatment (78.7 vs. 45.0{\%}) and did not affect the prevalence of clinical endometritis (23.9 vs. 18.6{\%}) or cytological endometritis (30.9 vs. 32.8{\%}). Prevalence of clinical endometritis increased in cows that had calving problems (32.6 vs. 15.9{\%}) and metritis (40.6 vs. 15.8{\%}). Metritis increased prevalence of cytological endometritis (50.7 vs. 23.5{\%}). Treatment with GnRH did not affect pregnancy per artificial insemination at 32 (37.6 vs. 38.6{\%}) or 74d after artificial insemination (35.0 vs. 31.5{\%}), but reduced pregnancy loss (6.8 vs. 18.1{\%}). No overall effect of GnRH treatment on hazard of pregnancy was observed; however, an interaction between GnRH treatment and ovulation showed that GnRH-treated cows that ovulated had increased hazard of pregnancy by 300 DIM compared with GnRH-treated and control cows that did not ovulate (hazard ratio=2.0 and 1.3, respectively), but similar to control cows that ovulated (hazard ratio=1.1). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone early postpartum induced ovulation without affecting uterine health, but failed to improve pregnancy per artificial insemination or time to pregnancy, although it reduced pregnancy loss.},
